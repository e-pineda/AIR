[Intro: 360]
Oi
Yeah

[Refrain 1: 360]
Ayo, I mean it, I mean it, I ain't tryna play around
I need it, I need it, you can prob'ly see it
You'll prob'ly think I'm gonna rip your heart to pieces
Get you in the sheets, and hit it up and leave ya
Believe it, believe me, you are gonna say
My reputation precedes me (Uh-huh), but you gotta be fair
Though you might'a heard about the numbers that I sleep with
That's not all I am, but at least there ain't no secrets

[Chorus: Gossling]
My mama always told me, papa always warned me
Don't hang around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don't mess around with boys like you
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you

[Verse: 360]
Ayo, you've heard about me, right? You're knowin' that my rep's renowned
Your friends will tell you stay away, because I've slept around
That's how it works though, the word'll get around
Back in the day it didn't phase me, yo, but lately it has kept me down
And yo, I brought it on myself, but I ain't mad about it
I kept count, but why the fuck did I brag about it?
And I'll admit it though, my rep is deserved
But I'll be real, I wanna kill it though, 'cause havin' that rep is a curse (Yo-oh)
My last girl cheated on me with a close friend
That's two relationships, I had to watch 'em both end
But see, it messed with me, the two people I trusted most
I could shrug it off on drunk'ness, but fuck 'em both
See, that switched somethin' inside of me
A beast came alive in me and started just eatin' away the pride in me
Because we're known to make mistakes and I've grown to make a change
I was different back then, but now I ain't the same

[Chorus: Gossling]
My mama always told me, papa always warned me
Don't hang around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don't mess around with boys like you
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you

[Refrain 2: 360]
Ayo, I mean it, I mean it, I ain't tryna play around
I need it, I need it, you can prob'ly see it
You'll prob'ly think I'm gonna rip your heart to pieces (I won't)
Get you in the sheets (Yeah), and hit it up and leave ya ([?])
Believe it, believe me, you are gonna say
My reputation precedes me, but you gotta be fair
Though you might'a heard about the numbers that I sleep with
Yeah, that might be true, but it's you I wanna be with

[Chorus: Gossling]
My mama always told me, papa always warned me
Don't hang around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don't mess around with boys like you
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you

[Intro: Gary Clark]
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, start again

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah, I've done stupid shit that I need to make up for
Your biggest nightmare can be your biggest wake up call
And I'm lucky I ain't still poor this life is what I'd kill for
Thought I got everything off my chest but there's still more
I'd change a lot of shit if I had time again
The price of fame is costin' me the life I crave
I can't believe these girls who wanna fuck me
When they know I got a girlfriend it honestly disgusts me
I bet before the fame they probably would of judged me
If I wasn't 360 then they wouldn't even touch me
All this substance abuse is so disgusting
I get over one thing then another drug gets subbed in
Went from a drunk kid to being a drug pig
Tellin' people that I'm clean, What a fuckwit!
Look at this random chick actin' like she knows me well
I'm sorry sweetheart, but I don't even know myself

[Chorus: Gary Clark]
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, so
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, start again

[Verse 2: 360]
Uh, yeah
Now all I want in Australia is a private life
To leave my house and not be seen, I need the right disguise
Sunnies to hide my eye and a scarf to cover the tats
I'm so anxious, fuckin' relax
See me and [Crystal] are done for sure
Stop askin' why is it, yo it's my business and it's none of yours
These little kids were so hopeful about us
I guess it's my fault for being open about it
It was hard for a while but I've moved on dude
But now both her and the public need to move on too
Now word on the street, she fuckin' an MC that I know
A dude I thought was my mate but needless to show
That even though I helped him get a name and feet on the road
I'm happy either way as long as she leaves me alone
Yeah, now look at these kids actin' like they know me well
I'm sorry motherfuckers, I don't even know myself

[Chorus: Gary Clark]
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, so
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, start again

[Bridge: 360]
Look at this random chick actin' like she knows me well
Sorry sweetheart, but I don't even know myself
Look at these little kids actin' like they know me well
I'm sorry motherfuckers, I don't even know myself
Look at this random girl actin' like she knows me well
I'm sorry sweetheart, but I don't even know myself
Look at these little kids actin' like they know me well
I'm sorry motherfuckers, I don't even know myself

[Chorus (Extended): Gary Clark & iK!D]
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, so
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, start again
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, so
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again

[Verse 1: Bam Bam]
Yeah, ah shit, six, we fuckin' running it now
Bam Bam, remember the name, suck it down
Yeah, I came to be famous and take the place of your favourites
While all these ignoramuses came here to fuck around
I'm amazin', but I'ma save it for y'all to say
And get 'em wasted, but I'm embracin' it all the same
And if you hate it, you probably take it straight in the anus
Ain't no way that I'm changin' it, babe, I was born this way

[Interlude: 360]
I'll take a bottle of Lanolin, squirt it in your fucking eye
And make you cry them dry moist tears
That you've been waiting to hold onto for years
You fucking soft cunt, I don't give a fuck!
Pots are probably your favourite type of material
Because you like flowers, you fucking pussy
I fucking hate you
Ketamine!
We don't give a...

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, if money grew on trees, yo, I'd smoke that shit
If I'm meetin' Mother Nature, I'ma poke that bitch
I'm a creep, but you motherfuckers know that shit
Such a pervert, fuck, even my phone has tits
It's probably for the best that I don't have kids
'Cause if my daughter farted on me, I would choke that bitch
Don't ask me for money 'cause I don't have shit
All I've got on me is this pipe that I smoke crack with

[Verse 3: Bam Bam]
Yeah, Stand The Fuck Up ain't just the name of the mixtape
It's what six says to me after the sixth day
Of a straight bender with no intention of ending it
No sleeping or eating and no sense in our sentences
(Can you pass the doob) We ain't ever giving a flying fuck
Flyin' as high as a kite, wired and fuckin' fired up
But on the off chance that you catchin' us driving drunk
At least it ain't with Ryan Dunn (Too soon?)
We don't give a fuck!

[Verse 4: 360 & Bam Bam]
Yeah, I was driving drunk with Ryan Dunn
But I survived the cunt, look, I'm alive as fuck
Man, you nearly died and I really thought that your time was up
That's why I did a line of drugs as long as his tire marks
I saw you crawlin' and climbin' out from behind the shrubs
Right after your car transformed like Shia LeBeouf's
I know the line was harsh, but we're just rhymin' bars
And if you analyse it, fuck it, yo, it's kind of smart

[Verse 5: Bam Bam]
Forever speeding, I'm always leadin' the fast life
Hard crime, doin' a bag of coke just to pass time
I'm still going from last night and it's half past nine
In the morning, I'm pourin' a glass of this cask wine
I really need to get home, yo, but I can't drive
Last time that I tried it, I passed out in the car twice
I've got to make it, I got a lady that's waitin'
A hot little-waisted Asian chick, but her titties are half white

[Verse 6: 360]
I ain't caring what you think, fuckhead
'Cause your girl's looking at me thinkin', ""Six, fuck yes""
She told me what she wanted, yo, we discussed it
And everything she said has left me disgusted
If you believe in God then I think you're a faggot
I wrote the Bible, I was trippin' on acid
Understand, motherfucker, I am six foot four
And with a line of coke I am six foot more
We don't give a fuck!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Oi, you a chat lad who would chat, lad, yap yap for a lap dance
You a snitch though with ya backpack, that is what I call a ratbag
Yeah, boy, was a rap fan, but the rappers here they be trash as
Saw THC up in a graf mag, that’s a motherfucking hashtag
Honestly, I'll kick ya sons nuts, you won’t ever be granddad
Then I'll break ya fucking spine, yo, that's the definition of Snapback
Working, I’m never not busy, this attitude, yo, I get it off 50
You wanna get it on with me, you could be Kobe's last game and you'll never drop sixty
You ain't dropping this
Like a eunuch, homie, no topping this
Whether battling or a song I did they keep yapping it like they wanna bit
Yo, they need to know that I’m adamant, it ain’t arrogance, yo, it's confidence
I’m a nice bloke, ain't it obvious? But in god mode, I’m on top a this
But at my shows I sell tix and ain't talking 'bout where Boston is
(Goddamn) You dunno what the roster is, and I ain’t talking 'bout a gab, but I got a gift
And getting off the piss and off the piff and off the sniff made me wanna jump off a cliff
Say no when I'm offered pip, better than ever whenever off the shit
I don’t care for your problem, I dodge 'em, you can get ya mug shot tryna rob the kid
Won’t back down, ain't the type to go chat now
If someone's turning their lights off all I say is I blacked out
They mustn’t know who raised me or the circles that I rapped 'round
Those same dudes who raised me you should see the circles I wrapped round
These past years been a big blur, in poor form, but I’m back now
My arm says keep evolving and I’m upping the level the way I rap, now
See the whole game gonna back out, when I stood up, homie, yo, they sat down
Every single thing that I wanna happen, yo, it's gonna happen 'cause it's mapped out
Couldn’t write with a crown on so I got it sitting in my lap now
If you wanna do it we can get into it, but I guarantee you're gonna tap out
In a battle they say 3 won, that's the way that all the votes go
All I’m hearing though, ""3.6., is it cool to get a photo?""
Of course it is, you don’t need to ask, but listen up because I’m so close
Said three-one-three-six, that's my old postcode if you don’t know
Went from hanging out at Eastland (Hanging out at Eastland)
To a massive house on the beach end (To a massive house on the beach end)
I ain't bragging 'bout my achievements, I’m saying anybody can achieve 'em
If you got a passion you believe in, if you wanna have it you can reach it
Just dream big (Get to it) Yo, it's obvious I been to hell and back
I'ma show the world where Melbourne at, this is my city, I'ma tell 'em that
(Where the album at?) Don’t tell 'em that, they're like ""Why's this not a album track?""
All the best shit I have held it back, but doesn’t matter, I got hella raps
No swagger jacking, they just yell on tracks, everybody here can tell I’m back
I’m on top 'cause you dropped off, now you in the middle like where Malcolm at
I can see I’m making fellas sad, like a telepath I can tell you that
I can tell you're mad 'cause I’m with a girl that is hella bad and you jealous as
She make more money than me, she make more money than me, yeah, she a boss bitch
Even on holiday she was a money machine, there ain't no off switch
You a germ, man that they gassing up, but no Auschwitz
Get 'em jumping 'round goth chicks in mosh pits at them rock gigs
Never mind, yo, I got this, 60 never been robbed, bitch
'Cause growing up in that Ringwood, boy, learned to hide my money where my sock is
Better get it, yo, you're not this, from the country of the convicts
I was living gritty, hitting skiddies, but this mini little city's where my squad is (Squad)
Dropped hits and then got rich, hitting 'em up with that bomb shit (Boom)
Understand when that bomb hits you’ll be breathing it in like that bong rip
If it's not 6 in your top pick then that topic getting top split
Yeah, it's your opinion, but it's wrong, bitch, this is god shit

[Intro: 360]
I'ma get on my sort of emo shit on this one
Gonna vent a little
I hope you don't mind
Yeah, listen

[Chorus: 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
And can I let it all out?
See I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out? (yo)
Yeah

[Verse 1: 360]
Ayo, I wish I had a time machine
To change the way that my mind perceives everything my eyes have seen
And make me look at life through a wider screen
It ain't what you might believe's happening behind the scenes
I treat the beat like an X-ray, press play
Lookin' inside, the best way to express pain
Fucking up is becoming something I'm used to
But sometimes to find yourself you gotta lose you
To those listening sorry for being emo
But fuck what the doctor says, this is what I need though
Yeah, and so I'm walking into that cloud
Where it has to hurt just to bring you back down
Almost became addicted to the painkillers
'Cause without that feeling, yo, the pain's killer
You'd think having a near death experience'd
Make a smart person take their life more serious
From nearly dying to feeling so enlightened
To nearly crying and feeling only frightened
Releasing this is hard, yo, it fuckin' hurts a bit
It's the only way I know how to come to terms wit' it
And this is Matt here, I'm giving you the real me
I just hope that you can feel me

[Refrain: 360]
And I know you're probably thinking I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

[Chorus: N'fa & 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
Yeah

[Verse 2: 360]
And with the partyin', I think I needa settle down
To be real, I'm getting a little messy now
A few drinks and I'm stressing out
In another state, looking for my own mum to come and get me out
I got no idea when I'm coming home
And all I want is to be left the fuck alone
I'm only being real, the depression comes and goes
Ignore it, 'cause tonight there is yet another show
Looking in the mirror like, ""What the fuck am I staring at?""
Not recognisin' the brutal mess that is staring back
So I'm giving you the deepest shit you'll ever hear
So if you got time for Matthew then lend an ear
I'm just hoping that I've said it clear
If I stay on this path, the end for 360 is gettin' near

[Refrain: 360]
I know you're thinking I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

[Chorus: N'fa & 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
Yeah

[Verse 3: 360]
I see my mates like my brothers, yo
I hardly see 'em anymore, the last time was a month ago
They either working or getting in relationships
I should do that too, but, yo, I hate the shit
Don't get me wrong, yo, I love women
With what I see though, it makes it hard for me to put my trust in 'em
All it takes is one person to fail you
And then you feel like majority will fail too
My insecurities'll swallow me whole
And, when they arise, yo, I'm not in control
They watchin' every move and they move with me
Like, ""Look at that dude, '60, that motherfucker's too skinny""
I can handle friends tellin' me I'm underweight
But, from a stranger, it's something that I fucking hate
I know you're unaware that shit's a low blow
But you feel the need to tell me like you think I don't know?
No, that's rude, find a bridge and jump off
And if I tell you to fuck off then fuck off
That's not being immature about it
That's me admitting I'm insecure about it
And yo I'm sorry if I'm seemin' insane
But I wrote this while I was at the peak of the pain

[Refrain: 360]
But now it's got me thinking I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

[Chorus: N'fa & 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain (I hope you don't mind)
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane (like I'm goin' insane)
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out? (let it all out, yeah)
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out? (let it all out, yeah)
Yeah

[Intro]
Ha ha, yeah!
It's 360
Forthwrite, '60 Cent
I like 'em fat

[Chorus]
Yo fatty, eat some more cake
And when it comes to food that's your forte
Never skip dessert unless it's a sorbet
I know that you don't give a fuck because it's gourmet
You can find me up at Smorgy's lookin' for an orgy
Searchin' for a fat-arse girl that's over forty
Handing out my digits, I'm gettin' 'em to call me
I'll go and give 'em cards if I'm really feelin' horny

[Ad-Libs]
Yeah, Weapon X and Ken Hell
A-Style, Forthwrite

[Verse]
I like fatties with attitude with boulders for tits
Where you don't need to raise your voice, you control her with chips
After you roll 'em in dips, they're so fat
That you face the sun holding their hips to cause a solar eclipse
Yeah, I like girls the obese type
Who don't eat right, with steamed rice but deep-fry their meat pies
On week nights they go shopping for Levi's
But they know their jean size is way over three-five
Always moody, they're too huge to be nice
Legs are so big they wear boob-tubes as knee highs
Let's get it straight, yo, I feed force 'em lemonade
Better than the featherweights who never takin' Jenny Craig
And if your girl's fat, there's no need to be whipped
All you need is full cream and it needs to be whipped
If you get the booty goin', grab the keys to your whip
Fatties like it rough, homie, yo, they need to be whipped
And I like it when their chin's saggin' below their titties
You know that '60 likes 'em over fifty like Oprah Winfrey
This one fatty fucked up her bandwidth
She went insane, tried to download a sandwich
What the fuck? I get 'em off the weight program
'Cause they ate smoked ham like the great Rosanne
I know there's a high rate of spike rape
But me? Fuck drugs, I spike 'em with carbohydrates
I love fat booty as big as Denmark
They're so fat on trains they purchase two Metcards
Yeah, I said the best arse is kept large
But fuck J-Lo, yo, I get hard for stretchmarks

[Outro: 360 & PEZ]
What? (Fuckin' fatties)
Fatties, come to me (Yeah!)

[Chorus]
I believe you become who you were
When you're old, but you get it quite late
Mr Future can you send a letter my way?
I'ma have a guess what the letter might say
If you could see who you were to become
Do you think you would do the same thing?
When it comes to girls would you play the same game?
When a baby girl's gonna take on your name

[Verse 1]
If the future you could go and write a letter to yourself
Imagine all the shit that it'd say
Makes me wonder if you reckon it'd help
In the way that you treat girls and the difference it'd make
I wonder if you would switch it up and respect women
Instead of tellin' all these lies just for sex with 'em
There's nothing wrong with having sex, but what's being a dog
Is you leadin' 'em on just so you'll get with 'em
Would you hit then kick her out so she's all alone
Instead of doing what's really right and walk her home?
Would you call 'em bitches? Would you call 'em hoes?
Or would you be riddled with guilt that you called 'em both?
'Cause when you go and have a baby girl you call your own
Those words, what if someone went and called your daughter those?
I know learnin' from your past is important though
I just think there's certain little things that you oughta to know

[Chorus]
I believe you become who you were
When you're old, but you get it quite late (quite late)
Mr Future can you send a letter my way? (my way)
I'ma have a guess what the letter might say
If you could see who you were to become
Do you think you would do the same thing? (same thing)
When it comes to girls would you play the same game? (same game)
When a baby girl's gonna take on your name

[Post-Chorus: Carl Dimataga & Whalan]
Maybe I will see you later
I'll see you later
Maybe I will see you later
I'll see you later

[Verse 2]
When you're young as fuck you run amok, always fuckin' something up
It's funny though, that attitude eventually will come undone
If your stomach's rumblin' and churning like there's something up
That's the beginning of you learnin' how to trust your gut
If you're hurtin' just be open, never suck it up
Force it out, homie, 'cause there's none above your mothers love
Back up what your brother does, always bring each other up
Make sure your father's proud of everything his son's become
I realise your guard's up and that you stubborn, but
Listen to your fam when they tellin' you you fuckin' up
Believe in yourself with no doubt, you're number one
Fuck shootin' for the fence, go ahead and touch the sun
When it comes to life, if I had to go and sum it up
The meaning of it all to me is simple: love and love
I know [?] shit can sound corny though
To me it's real as fuck and somethin' that you oughta know

[Chorus]
I believe you become who you were
When you're old, but you get it quite late (quite late)
Mr Future can you send a letter my way? (my way)
I'ma have a guess what the letter might say
If you could see who you were to become
Do you think you would do the same thing? (same thing)
When it comes to girls would you play the same game? (same game)
When a baby girl's gonna take on your name

[Post-Chorus: Carl Dimataga & Whalan]
Maybe I will see you later
I'll see you later
Maybe I will see you later
I'll see you later

[Outro]
So when you go and find your own wife you need to have your own lives
Have each others backs so you both strive, ayy
What's so important though is having your alone time
But even more knowin' that you don't mind, ayy
A life you cosign, live's that you both like
Never watchin' life as it goes by, ayy
What you got together's crucial that you both thrive
Otherwise the shit is gonna nosedive, ayy

Ah, mmm, oh, oh, good girl
Oh, mmm-oh, yeah, oh, oh
Oh, mmm, oh, 60
Call me Pez, call me Pez
What?
Nothing, nothing, shh

[Intro: 360]
Yo, Please Be Seated, bitches
Number two, bitches, what up, bitch?

[Verse 1: 360]
Yo, I don't understand your shit, yo, explain it first
Nerd rappers need to rap in layman's terms
For me though, it's fuck 'safety first'
It goes alcohol, drugs, then safety's third
In the last months, I have fuckin' wrecked shit
I'm a ball breaker, pun intended
I'll bust ya head 'til none forget this
Don't come correct then you'll come corrected
Fuck the world, go unprotected
Keep on going 'til it's fuckin' pregnant
I am never early
If I'm booked in at 6:00, then expect 360 at 7:30
Hey yo, bitch, cook me some eggs
And if they ain't runny, fuckin' cook 'em again
The last time I got stuck in a booby trap
Yo, I was like, ""Where the fuck are the boobies at?""
And this is how I be livin' in tune with rap
But why you gotta get rude with that?
'Cause these hoes on my dick 'cause I'm lookin' like Ted Danson
Maybe so, but Teddy is less handsome
I used to wake up, first thing, blaze up
Hey, yo, my taste buds only ever taste bud
Then me and Mary had a break up
See, I didn't want to but I didn't get the same buzz
Sick of livin' like a king for two days
Then spend the next fortnight livin' off loose change
I think I need a new name
Because I ain't made for livin' underground like Bruce Wayne
Uh, this the definition of Aussie swag
I got the crown, come get at me if you want it back
360 rockin' over Shutterbug
Because I, I, I am a funny cunt

[Chorus: Big Boi & Cutty (Sampled)]
Now party people in the club, it's time to cut a rug
And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbugs
I'm double fisted and you empty, you can grab a cup
Boy stop, I'm just playing let me dap you up
Baby baby, you're in my system
Baby baby, tell me you're listening

[Verse 2: GMC]
I said, ""Fuck you, dickhead, this is me styling""
Callin' you inferior and this is me dialing
I own this microphone
So go fuck yourself if you don't like my tone
Back, I'ma fuck you tip, ignant
I don't even know who the fuck you is
Non-discriminatory
High on skill, my flow got me feeling euphoric
It's GMC, so guaranteed this speed gonna need a burial for it
Now I don't skeet, watch me go ahead
And do a bunch of motherfucking aerials off it
I stunt with the flow, nobody double lead it
Write my own shit, like Robby Rodriguez
Ride my own dick, like I lovin' my penis
Also in love with Rosario Dawson
The things I'd do to Rosario Dawson
Would both be scary and awesome, Miranda Kerr
That's the question that I answer first
But then I gotta big load and I hand it to her
Buckle your seat belt, motherfucker
You buckle your seat belt now
Sending you in like an email now
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated
Tres-seis-cero and GMC

[Chorus: Big Boi & Cutty (Sampled)]
Now party people in the club, it's time to cut a rug
And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbugs
I'm double fisted and you empty, you can grab a cup
Boy stop, I'm just playing let me dap you up
Baby baby, you're in my system
Baby baby, tell me you're listening

[Spoken]
So this story, is about a really close friend of mine
I love you, brother

[Verse]
My mates talk shit about their wives, but I love mine
Yeah we fight sometimes, but ain't that just life?
She’s been pregnant now for some time, it took us years
And enough tries, I thought it wouldn’t happen from my young life
From the drunk times, or when I tried drugs twice
I thought downstairs had gone and messed it up, right
The doctor told me that I need to stop stressin’
The only thing that’s working against us is just time
That was true, two months by
My wife called me up while I was workin' at the pub, right
She told me I was gonna be a daddy
We both broke down, she said there’s something that I done right
I called my mother, told her I was gonna be a father
Mum cried, so did I, I was tongue-tied
I can't explain this feelin' but I love life
I’ve never had a purpose and this had just become mine
To create this little person that’s fun size
A little bit of her, and a little bit of me
But I pray he gets his mum’s eyes
I say he ‘cause I’ve always wanted a son, right
The ultrasound said it's a boy, my little ray of sunshine
It dawned on me, I can’t wait to see my son rise
You know what they say about time though? It does fly
Fast forward nine months and suddenly it’s crunch time
It's been a few days of goin’ through contractions
Gotta stopwatch timin' every moment that it happens
We reached five minutes so it’s hospital time
I call ahead to see the doctors arrive, my wife’s laughin'
Now I properly drive like the cops are behind
But there was barely any traffic so we got there in time
I’m a little scared, but she ain’t got a worry in sight
She’s a warrior, exactly what you want in a wife
It’s been several days of epic pain, every day she wakes up
Finally she's comin’ to that second stage of labour
I sit next to her, squeeze on her hand
Put a sponge up on her head and say, ""Breathe if you can
I love you so much, baby, you’re so strong
I could never do this but you so easily can""
She said the pain is insane like her abdomen’s ruptured
Like someone’s got a knife, and they’re stabbin’ her stomach
She’s like ""We have to do somethin',"" the nurse said, ""It’s natural
Relax, it's just a sign that it’s actually coming""
She’s like ""No, it’s too much, it’s too hard to get out""
I’m sayin’ any words I think’ll help at calmin’ her down
Doctor’s like, ""You’re nearly through the worst part of it now""
Take a look and see my little king is startin’ to crown
They all tellin’ her to push, and she’s screamin’
She’s saying that it hurts, I tell her to keep breathin’
It’s like ‘push’ is the only word that they’ve said now
Then I’m shocked by the massive scream she lets out
The doctor’s like ""Yes, now the head’s out""
And then I watch as he quickly pullin' the rest out
It’s so amazin’ to see my son in the flesh
I can’t help but notice he hasn't taken a breath, now
They put a little plastic thing in his mouth
While the doctor’s two fingers are slightly pumpin’ his chest down
I start panicking, something’s gone wrong
They push me to the side, I can barely see what’s goin’ on
He’s not breathin’, they need to resuscitate him
He’s suffocating, I see that it’s something major, I feel
So helpless, I wish I could come and save him
I pray that my son’ll make it, it’s taking ‘em fuckin’ ages
Everyone’s in shock, I’m just listenin’ in
Holdin’ my breath, wishin’ I could give it to him, fuck
At twenty minutes, now they’re stoppin’
They turn around, they say, ""We’ve lost him""
I’m in shock, I can’t talk
I’m starin’ at the ground, I can’t walk
They hand him to us, can’t believe the size of him
The most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen but there’s no life in him
My wife’s cryin’ like, ""Why aren’t they reviving him?""
I said, ""They tried for twenty minutes"" she’s like, ""Try again""
Now I’m feelin’ like I’m stuck in hell
This is the worst pain I’ve fuckin’ felt
I’ve been ten years clean, but now I’m drunk and on the drugs as well
I’m doin’ anything to numb myself, but nothin’ helps
I believed in God, for that I feel dumb as hell
Can someone please tell God to go and fuck himself?
I’m sorry, yo, it’s hard to be faithful
It's painful, heaven must be runnin’ out of angels
He died from asphyxiation, no air in his lungs
A parent should never have to bury their son
Especially one that’s so precious it has barely begun
That’s one thing in life that should never be done
I prayed for a son, and they blessed me with one
My biggest gift, now his presence is up
And I’m crying at the thought, he won’t ever feel a hug
Or the tenderness of love that he’d be gettin’ from his mum
Sent him from above, but why take him?
It’s like I'm being punished for the negative I’ve done
And it’s killin’ me that Christmas time is barely in a month
So I’m doin’ what I have to do to spend it with my son
(No)

[Chorus]
Where did you go?
Are you alone?
How did you get there?
I need you at home
Where did you go?
Are you alone?
How did you get there?
I need you at home

[Post-Chorus]
I need you at home

[Intro]
Just a thought

[Verse 1]
I understand people have a lot of questions
Maybe I could rap and give you answers with a message
A lot of times what I'm rappin’ is offensive
It ain’t serious, I’m sorry if I actually offended
""How does he ever write while he's battlin’ with depression?
He could end his life in the matter of a second""
Would it matter if I end it? Yes, I wanna show a
Disorder can be a gift it's just a matter of perspective
On this planet there's a fraction of its members
They have a talent and they have to be remembered
What I have is a profession, and my rapping is a blessin'
I don't even have to think, all I have to be is present
Somethin' higher though is tapped into my head
Dunno what it is but I'm just havin' to accept it
Like I have a spirit enter me, channeling an energy
And everything I rap it’s like I haven’t really said it
I probably sound like I’m gackin' off my head
I’m clean, it’s like divinely I’ve had an intervention
I understand that it's challengin' to get it
People'll misconstrue how I actually have meant it
For me this is proof that the galaxy is more
Than stars and the planets just randomly projected
I'm not saying that it had to be invented
But there’s something much bigger, no man can comprehend it
I believe in God, but not a man that is ascended
Standing in the heavens, judging every move you make
And banish you forever, if you’re bad then you won't get in
For me it’s more simple, like it’s actually a presence
Every life, every star, every planet and dimension
Everything is actually connected
See, there’s a God that’s ready to come alive in
Everybody on Earth, all you have to do is let it
You can be anything you actually invest in
You can’t wait for it though, you have to manifest it
The law of attraction is tragically presented
It’s the secret, it’s really hard to actually defend it
They made it out like you imagining a cheque
Or a house or a car, then magically you’ll get it
I’m a believer though, I actually digress
See, it goes a lot deeper though than cash and them possessions
If you doubt it, look at the placebo effect
That’s something that you have to be impressed with
A tablet was ingested, the tablet did nothin'
But in thinking that he had it was still havin' him affected
See every thought you have ever thought
What you truly believe, and your actual intention
It matters, there’s so much power in your mind
And as far as God goes, that is practically the essence

[Interlude]
Basically just believe in yourself
Embrace who you are
And love yourself and everyone else

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I love getting my vent on
I'm about to blow, picking up where I left off
To tide 'em over I just hit 'em with them songs
I got fifty more so I'm picking the best of
See I been building, I been getting my rest on
Yo, I can't wait to show these kids where my head's gone
And get my rappin' at it's tightest for the album that is timeless
So it’s crucial that I’m seeking the best on
And they keep saying I'm brave and I'm headstrong
But I can't help but feel like they're dead wrong
'Cause I can talk about my illness and issues with addiction
But I won't ever say where it stems from
'Cause barely anyone knows and I can't admit it
The truth really does hurt, it's too dark to give it
This is a life, we never wanna start to finish
We gotta give it everything from start to finish
In a team where we need to have the heart to risk it
Our one rule is shooting for the stars in this bitch
We're living such a life that it can’t be mimicked
Only ever setting goals if they aren’t realistic
Made to stand out, though we aren’t to fit in
Any nay-sayers and we aren’t to listen
And we spark a difference, making life that
Can’t be mimicked, the fact is though, you can't with limits
I was narcissistic, self-destructive, part sadistic
The wrong business I was partnershipping
I was a part of that party life, partying, then
Life fell apart, thank God that I parted with it
In this All-Star game, I’m the starter in it
Got that nineties fashion with the starter with it
People think I’m all about the fame, girls and money
But the fact is I really love the art of this shit
At the table where the winners be at
Fuck sticking to the rules, we ain’t limitin' that
We get enough to jump around, make the city collapse
And then we fly around the world doing victory laps
Let’s go

[Outro]
I just wanna thank everyone who’s been mad patient with me, and stuck by me through all this fucking bullshit I’ve been through.
But I’m back now and I’m not going fucking anywhere. I know this game like, especially in Australia, it’s really super competitive and shit. Everyone wants to be the fucking king. I wanna be the king, I'm gonna be the king. I reckon we should all share the kingdom. Fucking every rapper should believe they’re the king anyway.
Support anyone who’s killing it whether you like their shit or not. Fucking even if, even if we got personal issues I’m glad that you’re kicking goals, I’m glad that you’re fucking winning. We need more support, and uh, less ego. And any young rappers coming up, shoot for the fence. Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do shit, 'cause you fucking can. You can do whatever the fuck you want with the right belief and the right mindset. Go for gold. Just a thought.

[Chorus: JOY.]
You only call me when you're drunk, saying I might be the one
Talk me into it even though my intuition
Tells me not to listen, it feels so damn good
To hear your voice
And I don't want to quit it's like stepping on a cigarette
That just goes on
You're my favourite downfall
You're my favourite downfall, up all night
You're my favourite downfall

[Verse 1: 360]
Breathe me in, keep me inside
I'll be your friend, I'll teach you to lie
I'll bring you to life and I'll teach you to cry
You got a demon inside, hard to swallow when I'ma eat you alive
Yo, it's time to stop
I created all of these feelings that you keep fighting off
That commitment that you keep hiding from it is kinda gone
Why deny it for?
Meant to be with no strings attached, now we about to tie the knot
""I'm forever yours,"" no, you're forever mine
Without me happiness is something that you'll never find
'Cause I define you, listen to me and I'll guide you
You're defensive of everything I do, 'cause I've got you believing that I'm you

[Chorus: JOY. & 360]
You only call me when you're drunk, saying I might be the one
Talk me into it even though my intuition
Tells me not to listen, it feels so damn good

That just goes on
You're my favourite downfall
You're my favourite downfall, up all night
You're my favourite downfall

[Verse 2: 360]
Don't ignore me, I know you hear me, I ain't quiet
That wall you think is gonna keep me out, I walk straight by it
You're so fed up, try to run but I won't let you
You don't get it, like to think that you know better but you're no better
Will you leave? No, never, see I don't let up
One day I'm gonna come around and put you so low that you won't get up
(You won't) See, they say you're ill
There's something wrong with your head and that you gotta take some pills all because how I make you feel
But I'll make you feel, feel this
What would you rather: feel shit or not feel shit?
The meds will silence that devil in your ear
Until we're toe-to-toe though I will never disappear

[Chorus: JOY.]
You only call me when you're drunk, saying I might be the one

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah
I am naturally gifted and they hate that (they do)
I’m attracted to women, homie, straight facts (facts)
Woke up one mornin’ with a face tat'
Looked in the mirror like “Damn, I can’t replace that”
I got a multiple question before you take me home
Be honest with me, what’s your favourite show on cable though?
The Wire, Walking Dead, Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones?
If none of the above, bitch, turn around and take me home (U-ey)
I like when asses are big, it makes it harder to grip
I know that karma’s a bitch but she got marvellous tits
My career nothin’ but net, yeah, but it’s hardly a swish
Boy, you’re in over your head, homie, you’re garglin’
Piss, yeah, there’s nothin’ that I’m scared of
This is everyday shit, never been in rare form (never)
Walkin' round tellin' everyone that I'm in the Air Force (yup)
But they never seem to let it fly at the airport
I was the loosest, they will never not remember (uh)
Goin' out on a limb like gettin' legless on a bender
When it comes to rappers, dog, I'm the softest one out (truth)
I'm the type to shadow-box and get knocked the fuck out
I was the bright-eyed finite
In my prime time livin' life like this shit'd never skydive (breath)
A white guy tellin' all these people white lies
Like I wasn't chillin' where the white lies

[Chorus: Whalan]
Here’s to them white lies
Oh, to them white lies
Ooooo, baby, take my
All, ooh
Here’s to them white lies
Oh, to them white lies
Ooooo, baby, take my
All

[Verse 2: 360]
Uh, I love fashion but these hat fads
Went from fitted's to snapbacks to rockin' a fuckin' lad hat
Now everybody just walkin' around in dad caps
And all I wanna see's a legionnaires with a back flap (I do)
Yeah, I'm back, bitch (yep), I'm on that rap shit
I'm here to tell 'em that the fact is
That you can't have a foot fetish with anybody who's not good (why?)
There's nothing worse than gettin' off on the wrong foot (oh)
All my organs are weapons of mass destruction
I told my girl, she reckons that that's disgustin'
I got fire arms and a fuckin' missile toe ([?])
But I get more screams when I use my fingers though
Yeah, that's pretty gross, yeah, that's sorta wrong
Yeah, that's just the level that I'm talkin' on
I got a small dick and foreskin that's sorta long
When I take a piss it's like I'm fillin' up a water bomb (Gross cunt)
All the shit I did on drugs as a little cunt
I set fire to my pubes, it was lit as fuck (It's lit!)
And why is Snow White? (why?) 'Cause the winter came
I'd say danger's my middle name but, yo, the shit is James
I am L with a bit of Wayne, Drizzy
With a little Jay, a bit of Ma$e, Biggie, with a smidge of Ye (settle down, mate)
Honest guys, I don't wanna fight wit'cha
Got the flow on fire like the Condamine river

[Chorus: Whalan]
Here’s to them white lies
Oh, to them white lies
Ooooo, baby, take my
All, ooh
Here’s to them white lies
Oh, to them white lies
Ooooo, baby, take my
All

[Verse 3: 360]
I know it seems lately I get my ramble on
Fuck this bipolar shit that I have landed on
But with the right medicine and right therapy
It's made it somethin' that I'm managin' to get a handle on
Depends on the plane that you travel on
You can't handle the baggage, how the fuck can you carry on?
And deep down, yo, I can be strong
But the best way to do it though is go and get my rappin' on
Always doin' shit that I prob'ly shouldn't
On the dance floor three-oh never lost his footin'
Goin' HAM like ""He's the man, like goddamn""
When I dance like Neo when he's dodgin' bullets (believe that)
I could screenshot DM's and horrify Twitter
That girl out her mind, I don't wanna fight wit' her (Nope!)
But this male package is gettin' me fed x's
More than a woman who's endin' a text message
Kiss, hug, bae

[Refrain: Styalz Fuego]
There ain't no limit to us now
'Cause eventually always comes around
Oh, whether we die old or whether we die young
Gotta live it up till it’s gone

[Chorus: Stylaz Fuego & Dennis Dowlut]
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone

[Verse 1: 360]
Had a cloudy head, yeah, I know that
Since the fog cleared I’d never go back
And I’m grateful they shot me down
Or the person I am I would not be now
Yeah, it ain’t good to be bulletproof
'Cause in the end that bullet’ll be good for you
When I think of all the things I wouldn’t do now
If it wasn’t for that one little bullet wound
That means you gotta learn from mistakes
And no one person's the same
Don’t run from anything that hurts you to face
Each step you take you get further away
There’s a time when I thought of giving up
What I was living my life for it didn’t come
Now I haven’t got time for what I wouldn’t die for
I know that our life's short, so live it up

[Verse 2: Pez]
Yeah life's a journey I know that
And it doesn’t come with a road map
So you know to get through this maze
And along the way I made a few mistakes
Ever since then I
Left it all behind life's never been better
Head up in the clouds where it oughta be
Did it say life’s ordinary? But it’s not
Still for a minute I got in a rut
Imprisoned, I was limited and feeling stuck
Had my glass half empty, had to fill it up
Now I think I wanna get myself a bigger cup
That’s how the cards are dealt
Will it stay that way? Only time will tell
When I, think I wanna cry for help
I just try remind myself

[Pre-Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
There ain't no limit to us now
'Cause eventually always comes around
Oh whether we die old or whether we die young

Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone (gotta live it up)

[Verse 3: 360 & Pez]
I don’t know what the future holds
I don’t know if I’ll achieve my goals
I just know life’s beautiful
Maybe that’s 'cause I’m living on cruise control
'Cause truth be told it doesn’t matter if ya
Make it the whole way up the ladder, just as
Long as you’re living out your dream
They used to tell me it was out of reach, but now
I am flying at a thousand feet
Never looking at the ground beneath
See I got rid of all the doubt in me
Who I was ain’t shit on what I’m about to be, because
Growing up all I heard was the same story
And if I don’t learn well the blames on me
So I started saying yes today
To all the things I said ‘no’ to yesterday

[Outro: Styalz Fuego]
Oh, whether we die old or whether we die young
Gotta live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it's

[Verse 1: 360]

Uh
If I'm looking at you in the eyes then you better run
Never talk shit, if I want it I just get it done
Anybody sending me a threat yo they never come
You'll be knocking at the front door with an intercom
You could have your whole city there I'm like ""bring it on""
I feel the change in the atmosphere
I'm amazed at the way that you act so scared
I'm afraid that I have no fear
I'm the one to watch
You gotta know right now I'm a underdog
On my way back up, yo I love the top
To reclaim that crown that I fucking lost
Imma kill em' all
If they hit me in the face I'm like give me more
If they want it in the street then we gonna brawl
Everybody want a piece, I'm like ""give me war""
I'm messing you up
Hit you so hard that you'll never get up
Can you feel the adrenaline rush?
Better than any energy you ever will get from a drug

[Hook: 360]
Understand me it's (lights out)
Disrespect me it's (lights out)
If you want to go toe to toe we'll go blow for blow 'till it's lights out
Underrate me it's (lights out)

Sun on that come down
Sitting view while I come up
Don't want beef from them punchlines
You can get it like Ronda
Difference 'tween me and you
Nigga
Phones up while my phones off me
Me and '60'll leave you 6 deep, and we still yelling out one love
Take it on this bump off
I'm straight ill like I'm on drugs
Got a lot of people that do not believe in me
Cause they ain't mean shit where I come from
Walking 'round with my chest up
Block my dreams, better vest up but it
Don't matter, still gets splattered
Bitch I'm aiming for the neck up
The headshot
You fucking with a nigga then you're really gonna get it
On every beat I be killing it
I never see a limit I don't know where the finish is
In every race I be running motherfucker I be winning it
And I swear it's been a minute since I seen another kid writing records on the Guinness
If you wanna know the name of the next kid
Check back, insane, have a guess, bitch

Understand me it's (lights out)

[Verse]
I should be dead, maybe I got nine lives?
Seven left cause I've already died twice
I'm glad it wasn't bye-bye
Because it's my time to do it without the high-life
What I'm making is really dope
But I needa talk about some shit that happened a year ago
Hold up, let me clear my throat
Yo I'm about to get deep but I really hope you feel it though
See talking 'bout it hurts
Since when I was an addict but I was at my worst
No-one knew, I didn't tell one person
Couldn't bring myself to do it cause I felt like a burden
Give me any drug, I was chewing 'em up
If I have nine lives then I'm using 'em up
No-one knew my addiction, it was stupid as fuck
Ninety pills daily of Nurofen Plus
I know that's extreme and I should be dead right
But I was so fucked up my tolerance was that high
That's the thing with the codeine addiction
It's over the counter so you don't need prescriptions
That's three packets in a day
I didn't get high but I would have 'em anyway
Cause if I didn't take 'em then I'd be hitting withdraws
And guess what? All of this was mid-tour
And I can't play in this form
Having shit thoughts like I got nothing to live for
I was a zombie, I couldn't feel nothin'
I smashed four packets cause I just wanted to feel something
Yo, I overdosed for sure
I was at the venue, I was going to perform
I can't remember, see I was told in the report
My tour manager found me convulsing on the floor
Everyone surrounding, no one knowing what it's for
Literally no one knew that I was going through it all
I fucked up, I should be knowing this before
I'm a fucking junkie, how am I going on a tour?
I let down my fans and I owe it to them all
That's why I’m being honest and so open with it all
It's so hard no one knowing what is wrong
I can't talk about it so I wrote it in this song
Woke up in hospital going through withdrawals
Someone guarding my bed but nobody would talk
No phone there, nobody to call
Saying ""what the fuck is going on?"" and no one would inform me
And I’m not knowing whats it's for
Tubes everywhere, if only I could walk
A man approaches ""am I alright doc?""
Then he tells me I'm on suicide watch
I'm a danger to myself, I wouldn't be leaving
I didn't try kill myself but they wouldn't believe me
I spent a month in a hospital bed
Living in a nightmare and I just wanted to end
I'm thinking to myself have I got any friends?
Or friends who don’t use, have I got any left?
There's many times where I'd want to be dead
But we've lost too many and I don’t want to be next
Now I’m happy that I got me some rest
I know for sure now that I don’t want it again
The harder I hit the gym then the stronger I get
The more the devil on my shoulder hasn't got any strength
I let my fans and my family down
The people standing by me are like family now
Yo I’m sorry to anyone who's a fan of me
I understand if you wanted to abandon me
But if it wasn't for my family
I would've tied the knot on the rope the devil handed me
I gotta show ma' father and my mum love
And let 'em know that it's not them that fucked up
Now you got a quality son
If I say I’m gonna do it then the job'll get done
I embrace any pain, now I’m not gonna run
The gym's a new addiction but a positive one
The battle with addiction's a battle on its own
The worst part is that I tried battle it alone
So if your hearing this and your battling at home
Tell somebody because your family should know
I'm loving life now, I'm getting it back
If I can do this shit fucking anyone can
I can't remember cause I blacked out
But I wouldn't change a thing cause it made me who I am now

[Outro:]
Bless up
I'm back
This time I'm not gonna fuck off, I'm not gonna fuck up
I'm a different person
I'm not just saying that
I'm fucking loving life at the moment and I'm
Very grateful cause I should be fucking dead
And that's the truth
Thanks to anyone who's supported me lately
It's been insane, all the emails
All the DMs on Instagram, everything
Much love

[Hook: Gossling]
Fame, cars, lights stay on you
Cameras flashing for you
I’d trade it all on the way
To happiness. What’s the price of fame?

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah
Yo, what’s attracting people to the life of fame?
The nights away binging, getting blind for days
Would you expect a tidal wave of guys
All disguised as mates to try to take a slice of that pie you made?
When you’re famous, you’re the person people like to hate
Are you prepared for all the rumours and the lies they say?
Yo, looking back at life, I’d never thought I’d go this far
Yo, I’m just thankful people welcomed me with open arms
All these new friends and people that I hope to trust
Try to take advantage, got me thinking what their motives are?
Girl, if the light's on, on your iPod
And it’s my songs then drive on 'cause a fan is not what I want

[Hook: Gossling]
Fame, cars, lights stay on you

What’s the price of fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah
Imagine it, never thought I’d be havin’ it
Keep belief and be confident
But stay away from that arrogance
Yeah, I’m cashing in
That ain’t what’ll bring happiness
And I’m lucky, making a living off of this music
That’s what my passion is
And I could go and buy a crazy, fresh Mercedes-Benz
But I would rather help my mates in debt and pay their rent
Yo, I could make a trip to ATMs at 8am
After I’ve been placing bets and partying for days on end
Look what’ll happen if I never see the same success
Yo, in the schemes of things, I think there’s better ways to spend
When I was young, I saw my grandpa get laid to rest
And what I’ve got, I’d trade it in
If I could see his face again

[Hook: Gossling]
Fame, cars, lights stay on you
Cameras flashing for you
I’d trade it all on the way
To happiness. What’s the price of-
Fame, cars, lights stay on you

I’d trade it all on the way
To happiness. What’s the price of fame?

[Outro: 360 & Gossling]
Ain’t about all the money made
What’s the price of fame?
Think about what you wanna pay
Ain’t about all the money made

[Intro: 360]
Ayy

[Verse 1: 360]
They wanna know where 6 at (6 at)
When I hit 'em with this track they would likely retire (uh-huh)
The fact is I hate rappers as well
I'd rather battle myself and fight fire with fire (fire)
What I'm sayin' in my song'll amaze ya
What I'm tryna say is you'll get lost in it, ayy, brah
Honestly with the quality we droppin'
If you wanna degrade us it's gotta be A plus
I ain't listenin' to hip-hop these days
Everybody just a bunch of hip-hop clichés (true)
Go ahead and buy my shit off eBay
I'm here to break records like a pissed off DJ (snap)
Yeah, I can tell it in your melon
You developin' a habit, better gallop into rehab (rehab)
Uh, I'm a fellow without manners
Not a felon, I'ma Khaled 'em and tell 'em where the keys at (another one)
I can smell it, where the weed at?
Honestly, homie, yo, I can tell you're gonna relapse, relax
You're a dope fiend for the codeine
You're a Fat Joe fan, got you yellin' for the lean back

[Chorus: 360 (PEZ)]
Coup de grâce, coup de grâce
Anyone can get it, I don't care who you are (uh-uh)
Coup de grâce, coup de grâce
I don't give a fuck who you are

[Verse 2: PEZ]
I been lookin' around, but I still haven't found my place
That's why you see me drift off into outer space
All you down-to-earth rappers can eat sour grapes
Or a sour steak, my whole fuckin' fridge is out of date
I rocked up to the studio an hour late (yeah)
And snuck in like, ""Hey guys, it sounded great""
I swear to God, I hear another of you welterweight
Rappers who sound the same and there'll be fuckin' hell to pay
(Man) I'm feelin' back in my element
Like I'm channeling the Devil, writing rap for the hell of it
To remind these motherfuckers that I'm actually talented
I don't want to but I have to keep tellin' 'em (what's that)
I can pad this verse out with lyrics that are six years old
'Cause I wrote better shit than you when I was six years old (it's true)
All you rappers from the new school who just enrolled
If you don't know that I'm the shit then you just been told (bitch)

[Chorus: PEZ (360)]
Coup de grâce, coup de grâce
Anyone can get it, I don't care who you are (I don't though)
Yeah, coup de grâce, coup de grâce
I don't give a fuck who you are

[Verse 3: 360]
Yeah
You ain't sicker than this fidgety bitch (nup)
Lyckety-Splyt stick to the script and play the role you given (yeah)
Thinkin' your shit's bigger than this, no, it isn't
I'ma put your head in a box, boy, you goin' missin'
I got a chicken, I ain't talkin' 'bout a parma, ayy
Pull-out game strong, I ain't comin' to your party, mate
Mad at the buzz, your alarm is late
Reverse kanga, this shit is hard to take
Look, decided it's finally time for bravado
Line after line after line like a barcode
You trash cunts who ain't worth the work
So go and pull yourself together like a circle jerk, motherfuckers

[Chorus: 360 & Seth Sentry]
Coup de grâce, coup de grâce
Anyone can get it, I don't care who you are (yeah)
Coup de grâce, coup de grâce
I don't give a fuck who you are (nope)
Man, coup de grâce, coup de grâce
Anyone can get it, I don't care who you are
Uh, coup de grâce, coup de grâce
I don't give a fuck who you are

[Verse 4: Seth Sentry]
Man, I'm doin' shit my own way
I'm kicking bubblegum and chewing arse (yeah)
Slidin' through your studio inside a Uber car (skrrt)
Jumpin' out with two bazookas and a suit of armour
Blew apart the booth and puff a doobie, go to Zumba class
You ain't the sickest, you're a hypochondriac
So just loosen up (relax), go get some juice in a chicken noodle cup *slurps*
I got a pandemic flu and I'm pukin' up
Blood full of AIDS, the bubonic plague and a case of whooping cough
Jumpin' Jupiter, who would ever assumed that the
Goofiest kid in school would've grew to be even stupider
Screw the tutor, I'm huffin' a tube of glue in a cubicle
Ate a urinal cake and I think it's caught on my uvula
All I wanted to do was to rap and improve and do better
Boostin' up all of my skills, feel like you didn't get the newsletter
Now I just wanna ruin your buzz, I'm a fuckin' mood killer
You should evacuate from the place 'cause I'm goin' nuclear
So fuck bein' the sharpest tool in the shed, I just grab it
And stab your crew with it, who want it? Pshh, I'll fuckin' ruin ya's
Takin' your cash cow and I grill it and serve it back to ya
There's some barbecue rap for ya, chew it up, it's the coup de grâce

[Verse 1: 360]
I'm at the Kwik-E-Mart to find where the Simpsons are
I got money to give Bart 'cause he ticked me shard (come again)
Yo, someone tell me where the strippers are
I get it poppin' like throwin' ninja stars in a titty bar
It might be a bit bizarre
But I'm at my best friends funeral I'm cryin', but my dick is hard
My mate showed me his minibar (check out my minibar)
I couldn't stop askin' the cunt where the fuckin' midgets are
Last week, I bought a Nixon mask
Stole Bill Clinton's car and drove it into Monica Lewinsky's spa
My girlfriend's a Gypsy with a job to do
I'll sign your CD, she'll rob your shoes and your wallet too
Drive by in a Commodore, ride right to the bottle shop
Rock tie die, no knife fights I'm a white guy with a tomahawk
Pause and ask the owner if he knows the fuckin' soccer score
If our team's losing then we're fuckin' up his shop some more

[Chorus: Pancho]
I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
Yes, I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake

[Verse 2: 360]
I think from all the benders I've rocked and all the ecstasy popped
I suffer memory loss which means I don't remember a lot (what's that mate?)
I like machetes because it's the weapon I've got
Use it start connect the dots and your freckles and spots
Even when I'm not right I'll never be wrong
I'm levels beyond, on a level that you won't ever be on
I take a photo of how Jesus died and I'll text it to God
Message across
I got a question for God, if we got the first Testament wrong
Tell us where we got the second one from
Yo from this day I never will flop, you want proof?
I'll stab the end of my cock with this adrenaline shot
Hey yo, my cock is a Cyclops, got Nikes on and they're high tops
Meet you then tell you that your girl got a nice box
Everything I do in life is quite wrong
Need an apple a day, so I stole your fuckin' iPod

[Chorus: Pancho]
I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
Yes, I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake
I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
Yes, I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake

[Verse 3: Lunar C]
I getting it in when I get in the ring
It's a right left to the chin, I side step then I swing
Got two bisexual identical twins
In my ride, dressed up as gimps on a wild ketamine binge
Getting more head than forceps
You get T-bagged for sleepin', I let my balls rest on ya forehead
If you're wondering why I haven't said ""pause"" yet
And presumin' I'm talking about a dude then you're bent
Speakin' at the court hearing naked, with my balls shaven
That's what I call a bald statement
Whole world on my shoulders, didn't think that I could balance it
But it's lighter than you think like Michael Jackson's kids
You don't know where the fuck you been, from Bradford to Melbourne we run this thing
Took your chick to go fuck but the slut just sucked my dick till she bust a lip
Fuck what I said before, I ain't got no money bitch
Girls call me an arsehole 'cause I'm tight as fuck and full of shit

[Chorus: Pancho]
I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
Yes, I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake
I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
Yes, I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late

[Verse 1:]
Jump on my cloud, we can float to the sky
We can go to my home if you like
We can go to where nobody flies
All it takes is to open your mind
We be heading up crazy high
So come if you ain't afraid of heights
Come aboard and we'll chase the sky
But know you will literally change your mind
It's all good, we can take our time
Where we're going yo there ain't no time
I want you all to meet a mate of mine
And if you see reality then wave good-bye
You would never think to go here
Yo, you're going to have a grin from both ears
When you finally find this place you can hide away while we live with no fear

[Hook:]
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ahh ahh ahh, I'm running away from my faith, but I won't run alone
Ahh ahh ahh, I don't want you to love me but I'd love if you want to run
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh

[Verse 2:]
Here, take a little bit of this and
Wash it down with a little bit of drinking
Watch it now any second it will hit
But don't over do it in a minute it'll kick in
Looking down from a bird's eye view
See me running from a world like you
Yeah it might be your first time
But with me you don't need a return flight, true
This is what the galaxy's for
We'll come down when gravity calls
I understand that there has to be more
You ain't seen this planet before
All it take is to ride the right cloud
You just gotta look inside to find out
If you wanna have the time of your life then
Stop thinking the time is right now

[Hook:]
Ahh ahh ahh, I'm running away from my faith, but I won't run alone
Ahh ahh ahh, I don't want you to love me but I'd love if you want to run
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh

[Bridge:]
Do you want me
We're a thousand mile away from anyone
Do you want me
If you want then run
You want then run

[Hook:]
Ahh ahh ahh, I'm running away from my faith, but I won't run alone
Ahh ahh ahh, I don't want you to love me but I'd love if you want to run

[Hook 1:]
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you

[Verse 1]
I had a father who came from nothing
He took that and he made it something
He’d seen it all by his twenty-first, right
His mum and dad both left this Earth, why?
It was the drinking that killed his mother
He’s watching the same thing kill his brother
And he doesn’t say it much but he really loves us
And he doesn’t want the same thing to kill his sons
When he sees me with a drink in my hand
I understand now why he thinks that it’s bad
'Cause he knows that it’s so evil
But he knows we’re our own people, so he lets us go

[Hook 2:]
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you

[Verse 2:]
See, I don’t know if God’s real
But, if he is, I can image how God feels
And there’s things I’d discuss with him
I bet he wouldn’t change much but there’s shit he would have done different
When my grandpa passed away
I remember saying bye on his last few days
And I’m hoping there’s a heaven
I want to meet again
And I never met anybody as positive as him
Not many were as sick as him
But he didn’t let the illness kill his grin
And that’s why I went ahead and inked my skin
'Cause I remember the smile when I think of him

[Hook 2:]
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you

[Verse 3:]
I didn’t know that my brother got bullied in school
If I could go back now, I wouldn’t be fooled
He probably thought mum and dad don’t fucking care
But it wasn’t even that, they were so unaware
Living in a family where money is favoured
Makes us want to say, I fucking hate it
Brother though, we gotta feel blessed as fuck
Just remember, they only want the best for us
We got a mum that’s an angel, I’m thankful
Just to even have her in my life, I am grateful
Family is anybody that close to you
See this song right here, it is overdue for you

[Hook 2:]
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you

[Intro: Bliss & Eso]
Hey yo, Macka, how you feeling today?
I feel unified, mate. Shit, I'm feeling the same
This is paradise, so enjoy the weather
A perfect time to get the boys together
We need old school, new school pioneers
Who can flip that shit like primal fear
Sun's up, man, I'm callin' the lads
One love, that's twelve balls in the bag

[Verse 1: Eso]
Yo, my crew's on some bullshit
And I ain't talkin' 'bout a poo that a bull did
I'm talkin' 'bout what sets the bar
BnE, Seth, '60, PEZ and Drapht

[Verse 2: Bliss]
He said ""sets the bar"", that'll blow like Escobar
Six dogs out the reservoir
Let's play connect the stars
And paint a circus in the sky, yeah, PEZ can start

[Verse 3: PEZ]
Yeah
Now we thought this crew should pull
Out something a little unusual
Sounds a bit like a musical
It doesn't matter, we make any kind of music cool

[Verse 4: 360]
Yeah, uh, when I heard the word footpath
I just thought it meant it was a foot large (I did)
But then I walked on a footpath
And I had a look, and I swear it was a good yard

[Verse 5: Drapht]
Yeah, rule of thumb
Never been the one to open up a can of worms
Never underestimate
'Cause some say we the best to date like Miranda Kerr
Hi Seth

[Verse 6: Seth Sentry]
News flash alert
Something stirred underground where the rappers lurk
In a cloud of weed smoke, with a hand full of Cheetos
I'm in Beast Mode, you better enter a cheat code

[Chorus]
Now check it out, look who's up in the mix
You can dream, but you ain't seen nothing like this
This place is off chops, like I'm waitin' for a mate
So just ""give me the mic"" so I can take it away

[Verse 7: Eso]
I'm like Outkast mixed with South Park
And my rhyming flow is like Dynamo
So when I bust on the beat
I'm rude like Cube yellin' ""fuck the police!""
Raise 'em up
It's like all your Christmases came at once
Yes, we're too much for these rookies
Seth, let's knock the dust off their pussies

[Verse 8: Seth Sentry]
Man, I feel awesome, nah, I mean awful
Yeah I'm pretty sure I've put on weight since Autumn
Pass me the pork roll, don't really walk anymore
Ever since I invented a gun that shoots portals
Yeah, my body's gone bad
Tried to get myself a Hollywood tan
Me and Drapht went to Bali for a holiday, man
I must've put the weed in someone else's bodyboard bag
Fuck

[Verse 9: PEZ]
Leadin' from the get go
Yes, I believed it, even when they said no
Yeah, fear's like half of your thoughts
Follow your heart, that's par for the course
Of course it ain't easy
I can tell you that first hand, but it's all good
Look at us, went from studying the fundamentals
Back when we were young and now we're up here on another level

[Chorus]
Now check it out, look who's up in the mix
You can dream, but you ain't seen nothing like this
This place is off chops, like I'm waitin' for a mate
So just ""give me the mic"" so I can take it away

[Verse 10: Drapht]
(Yeah, check it out, yo)
This sounding like some Austin Powers shit
Someone gotta tell '60
This ain't the sixties, this ain't the same mixed
Bag of lollies, that ain't the same Frisbee
Interesting, yes, I guess
I can adjust, I guess it just means
That we gotta do it different. Good
And I'm glad 'cause the records are wrecking my Discman

[Verse 11: 360]
When I heard the beat on, I said turn it off
I thought it was the theme song from Circus Oz (turn it off)
I'm being serious, I don't give a fuck how
Turn down the sample and switch up the drums now
I got the sick drum loop
Walking 'round the city in my pink gumboots
If a hater wanna talk like ""Six, fuck you""
I tell my bodyguard ""Smash this cunt too""

[Verse 12: Bliss]
Last shot of the six slug revolver
Tree swingin' in on a big fucking Cobra
Shit cunts, it's over, with my honourable brethren
It's destined, Mr Orange done stepped in
The card shark, the way I play in the carpark
Doing doughies, spin a rapper out like Nardwuar
And Izm, here's a line to scratch
Hate, ""Ain't nobody got time for that""

[Pre-Chorus]
Good god look who's up in the mix
You can dream but you ain't seen nothing like this
So there goes the neighbourhood get elevated with us
It's like ""UNITY"" it's a celebration, bitches, good god

Now check it out, look who's up in the mix

[Verse 1: Iron Solomon]
My grandfather Solomon was wiser than the norm
Never met him 'cause he died before I was ever born
But then my father in his honour dubbed me with his name
His legacy remains and his blood is in my veins
They said when I was born you could feel it in the room
Oversee the baby boy get delivered from the womb
With the ghosts of all the poets and the killers and the goons
And the souls of fallen soldiers who were buildin' the platoon
Breathing life into my lungs like air in a balloon
So they can see me rise above from the ceiling to the moon
So that when I'm dead and gone and I'm buried in a tomb
Then my music can live on and my spirit will resume
So I'm delivering my own recital, influenced by all my idols
Singing every note as Michael, spitting like I wrote the bible
Swinging like I hold the title, hitting like I'm homicidal
Kicking like a loaded rifle, this shit is the older cycle

[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
You know my grind came for dollar after dollar, boy, we gets it in
That life could turn kids to men, woman dope needle prick the skin
Barrels on a plate can spin, real niggas that twist ya brim
Church go and switch the sin, no confusion, we gets it in
[?] with mamas that visit [?] in Michigan
Settle beef in advance, wear the pants with the pistol in
My close circle move in silence, that's why we whisperin'
Make no mistake about it, get outed and see we gets it in

[Verse 2: Okwerdz]
Yo, where I come from it's a short line of workaholics
So at birth I already earned a lifetimes worth of knowledge
Where I come from who you party with the night before
Could get murdered by the morn', by the time you wake up, life is short
Where I come from wasn't always so supportive
Years of touring, lots of torment, had to build up my endurance
But now I'm with my fans throwing deuces for the pigs
Got a hold of my dream and I ain't loosenin' my grip
Nah, no matter what gets up in my way
Lost a few fake fans from decisions that I made
But most of them wouldn't even admit it to my face
So I don't believe the love and I don't listen to the hate
I'm just doin' me, I know exactly where I came from
The [?] page were champions or made up
And I don't need no bandwagon fuckin' fans
So if I lose you along the way I completely understand, goodbye

[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
You know my grind came for dollar after dollar, boy, we gets it in
That life could turn kids to men, woman dope needle prick the skin
Barrels on a plate can spin, real niggas that twist ya brim
Church go and switch the sin, no confusion, we gets it in
[?] with mamas that visit [?] in Michigan
Settle beef in advance, wear the pants with the pistol in
My close circle move in silence, that's why we whisperin'
Make no mistake about it, get outed and see we gets it in

[Verse 3: 360]
Yo
Yo, where I come from we started playin' sell out shows
Now these narrow-minded fools think we sellouts though
I might not always rap on hip-hop beats
But guarantee I'll be all up in that kids top three (it's true)
Yeah, I ain't scared of the rise and the fall (nah)
Frankly I'm more afraid of the height of it all
And in my mind I am fightin' a brawl
Reading off invisible ink that you might find me writing on walls
Listen, I am way up here (yeah)
And fuck the negativity you bringin', I'ma stay up here (yeah)
When I dropped ""The Take Off"" things started to take off
But no way I'll ever be forgettin' where I came from (uh)
I see success in dudes gettin' their hate on
I'd be selling out to make songs for what they want
And understand we all chasin' the same dream
Reppin' on the same team, all of us the same breed

[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
You know my grind came for dollar after dollar, boy, we gets it in
That life could turn kids to men, woman dope needle prick the skin
Barrels on a plate can spin, real niggas that twist ya brim
Church go and switch the sin, no confusion, we gets it in
[?] with mamas that visit [?] in Michigan
Settle beef in advance, wear the pants with the pistol in
My close circle move in silence, that's why we whisperin'
Make no mistake about it, get outed and see we gets it in

[Intro]
Hey, Lleyton
I've been told a couple of times that I look like you, right?
Now, I don't mind that
But, in my opinion, I deserve Bec a lot more than you do
I've put in more ground work, I've been there a lot longer
And I love work a lot more than you do
So, I think it's time to give her up
Please!

[Hook]
[?]
[?] Mamma Mia
Now, I don't even know what that means
But it sounds good so I'm gonna just sing it
[?]
[?] Mamma Mia
Yeah, this one's for Snuzzleberry
That's my pet name I gave her

[Verse 1]
Yo, I remember watching this girl on Home and Away
Wouldn't miss an episode if I was home or away
I really wanna put my little hands up in her bra
While I'm glancing at her arse, watching Dancing With The Stars
Little Aussie queen I define, how's that?
I really love the way you get them eyebrows waxed
You'll see me every year, lurking in the grandstand
Eyes locked on Bec while the rest of the fans chant
This whole time, I've been dreaming of a lap dance
I'll show Lleyton the true meaning of a backhand (take that motherfucker)
And, really, he should be an honest register
As a non-competitor that could never beat Roger Federer
And I'll be honest though, Australia's hoping
For Lleyton to stay away from the Australian Open
(Nah, you can't come in) He wants to slap me? He better get the stilts out
She was hot before, guess what?, she's a milf now

[Hook]
[?]
[?] Mamma Mia
Now, I don't even know what that means
But it sounds good so I'm gonna just sing it
[?]
[?] Mamma Mia
(I see you every year at the Oz Open)
Please look at me next time!

[Verse 2]
Yo, it's like every year at the Oz Open, I'm feeling loneliness
Switch up my style every time, hoping that she notices
And, last year, I thought I'd go in as a chauvinist
Pull the helicopter out and yell ""Please notice this!""
I find pictures of her, surfing the net
Or you'll see me on the main court, surfing a net
And, everywhere she goes, you'll see be perving on Bec
I'll lurk under steps if she's in a skirt or a dress
I'm sorry Bec but I'm really jealous of Lleyton
I've seen you cook breakfast, I was smelling the bacon
I died when I found that you were marrying Lleyton
But I like cornflakes (that's an irrelevant statement)
You've got the worst voice for a TV host
I'd still let you talk on my CD though
Everybody can see it, even BP knows
We all agree, you need to break up with that peewee, yo

[Hook]
[?]
[?] Mamma Mia
Now, I don't even know what that means
But it sounds good so I'm gonna just sing it
[?]
[?] Mamma Mia
(I dream about you every night
But you don't love me, you don't love me)

[Verse 3]
I was with Bec Cartwright in my bed last night
The dream was so good that I slept past nine
But, when it comes to really having sex, I'm fine
I've got my Woman's Weekly magazine when I have a dream
Mamma Mia, the mother of Mia
Could turn me from a Satan to a mother Teresa
We'll get food nasty, having fun with a pizza
I'll be your only lover if you chuck me a Visa
Cheesy but true, sleasy but smooth
I'll show you another sport that's easy to do
Yeah, so what? I use a mic and not a tennis racket
But you could get a real rock star like Lenny Kravitz
Yeah, it's true that I like celebrity types
Because the TV bimbos are what kept me alive
And now, I've got my sights locked on Jennifer Kye
Why? 'Cause Greg Norman said the sex was all right

[Hook]
[?]
[?] Mamma Mia
Now, I don't even know what that means
But it sounds good so I'm gonna just sing it
[?]
[?] Mamma Mia

[Outro]
All those celebrity females, watch out
That's my whole thing, that's all I'm about
That's the only reason I rap, is so I can get closer to you guys
At the awards nights
Lara Bingle, Bec Cartwright, Kerri-Anne Kennerly
Fuck yeah, you're all gonna get it
It's all gravy Lleyton
Don't take offense, little boy
Come on!

[Verse 1: 360]
Ayy
I was smashing Skittles any minute I can (I was)
Until I started looking like the Michelin Man (I did)
So now every day I hit the gym in the tan
So I can be heavily armed without a pistol in hand (Let's go)
Any form of exercise, there isn't a plan (Nup)
If Jesus walked on water then I'm swimmin' on land
(Check this cunt out) It doesn't matter when I listen to trance
I can't help but break into this ridiculous dance
It's like a faster running man, but I'm kicking and flicking my hands (Woo)
Understand I'm the shit and I think I'm the man (I do)
Yeah, bulking on these motherfuckers
Incredible Hulkin' on these motherfuckers
I'm the dude in the gym, training his upper body
With pants on 'cause downstairs there's nothing on me
Check my damn pins, not a damn thing
Yo, my hamstring actually looks like an actual fucking hamstring
The damn gym's the only thing that I'm advanced in
Bustin' out reps in the tempo that I dance in
Incredible back, impeccable traps
And when I'm topless I'm never relaxed, I'm flexing my abs ([?])
In cardio I'm the best on the map
I even forget where I'm at to give my memory laps (Think about that)
I'm so obsessed with fitness that I'm the definition
When I rap, I even get the record skippin'
I got a thick neck, but shit legs, ayy?
Do some fuckin' squats then, Nah, I got a big headache
Ah, typical 6 fuck, skip leg day
Cunt, we'll do it tomorrow, man, I'd rather hit chest, ayy (You fuckin' pussy)
I do ten sets on the bench-press
Then do ten reps on the peck deck, I've got the best chest
And if you want the same then listen to your sensei
(Do it) Yeah, fuckin' 6 is really making sense, ayy?
You want the best shape? Go and get your chest great
Fuck your legs, mate, only worry about your pecks, ayy
You gotta work out the best way, where every day is chest day
Yeah, it's Forthwrite, Dem Gainz

[Chorus 1: 360]
If you wondering where 6 been lately
You can catch me at the gym, baby
It shows I got my pecks so strong
Everybody sayin' that my chest so bomb (This cunt's massive)
I know you prob'ly thinking this shit's crazy
Upper body is the shit, baby
You know I got my headphones on (Check it out)
Won't believe that it's a techno song
Just leave me alone (Yeah)

[Verse 2: PEZ]
The moment that I walk in the gym
You're like, ""What the fuck's my girl doing talkin' to him?"" (Sup babe)
A workout's better the shorter it is
So I'm calling it quits before it begins
Walk straight up and disconnect the exercise bike
See people looking mesmerised when I ride by (Bye)
From the time I was born, I was never quite right
You wanna hide your flaws, I'm tryna emphasise mine
So while they try and get all energised, I
Don't give a fuck about my tris and my pecks and my bis (Nah)
I'm tryna blend in with the rest of my kind
And look like every white guy I've ever met in my life (Okay)
Lookin' skinny on these motherfuckers
See my arms? Muscles are mini on these motherfuckers
All these lames say it's gain season (It is)
Nah, I'm tryna find ways to train so my frame weakens
That's a main reason I spend the whole time
I'm here walkin' 'round, daydreaming in a daze schemin'
'Cause time is money and shit's expensive
So I ain't leavin' till I break-even, yeah
It's hard to summarise it, but well
In a nutshell, I won't touch a dumbbell
I'd rather walk up on these dickheads who are big and buff
While they're standing in the mirror and then interrupt ([?])
I hear 'em call me skinny like I give a fuck
I'm 'bout to get a nip and tuck just so I get skinnier
I idolise those skinny runts bumming ciggies in the city, bruh
And I'm not giving up till I look similar
And this is sincere, I been at this gym for six years
People wonder why I'm even in here
It's 'cause I hate workin' upper body, man, I can't take it
But if there's legs bein' worked out then I'm partaking
See me half-baked in my apartment
Stark naked, doing calf raises till my heart's racin'
And I'll start pacin' till my feet'll hurt
And do a shitload of cleans, I don't need the jerk
I'll even spend a whole night in a squat rack
How many reps is that, PEZ? I don't know, I lost track (Fuck it)
I want my top half lookin' like I'm on crack
But I want my glutes and my calves and my quads jacked
And if you want that too here's a template (Yep)
To get your flex game better than your best mate (How?)
You gotta workout the PEZ way and only train on leg day
Forthwrite, Dem Gainz

[Chorus 2: PEZ]
If you wondering where PEZ been lately
You can catch me at the gym, baby
You know that when I flex those quads
They're sayin', ""How'd you get your legs so strong?"" (Check out his fuckin' pins)
I know you prob'ly thinking this shit's crazy
Lower body is the shit, baby
You know I got my headphones on (Yeah)
Best believe that it's a techno song
Just leave me alone

Woah! (Forthwrite) That's what people say when they see us. It's like, ""Woah!"" (360 and PEZ) Like a rude awakening. Like a massive shock. Like, ""Woah!""

[Verse 1: 360 & PEZ]
Hey yo, we kind of stand out of a crowd, yeah, you notice this
Only ice that I try to smoke is the frozen shit (Uh)
If you think I'm gonna pass blame you silly son
Only finger that I'm ever pointing is the middle one
Now I'm talking in a little conversation
There's a crowd so just switch off your patience
Now raise up your hands, we making a stand
Hold 'em up and wave, just wave, wave
You know were better than the norm and if you question it you're gone
So just believe it and leave all of that aggression at the door
All who even entering the place know
That we're real rapper nice, so just chill back and vibe a little bit
You might sit, sipping on your wine
But I get sick of just sitting in one position for the night
So I like to move and find my mood
Just wave your hands side to side if you like this groove
It's like that, now back to the matter at hand
If you're an arrogant fan then get to clapping your hands
And go crazy, don't do it any other way
The party's right now, now everybody say

[Chorus: 360]
Woah! Everybody going sick in the crowd
You all know what we're singing about, just get loud
Woah! Make the place jump, go and turn the bass up
If you wanna raise up, everybody say ""Woah!""
Woah! Everybody going sick in the crowd
You all know what we're singing about, just get loud
Woah! Make the place jump, go and turn the bass up
If you wanna party then throw your hands up high

[Verse 2: 360 & PEZ]
Yeah, 60's in the house
While I'm kickin' this rhythm at all the kiddies sitting down (Yep)
If you be drinking it go and stick it in your mouth
Even if it's nearly full then you're finishing it now, yeah
Fans chant [?] light the fuse
If you can't dance, damn, man, buy some booze
And clap hands from the grandstand, riot too
Make this show wild enough to hit the nightly news
On Channel 9 and 2, and then on 7 and 10
Until every regular resident reckons that it's repetitive (What?)
You know the game when you got fame on your mind
I'm tryna get myself a plane so I can take it and fly
Away to the sky and write, ""Yo, I made it"" in white
With my name next to it, yeah, my aim is to try
And get so famous I can go places
And get my own waitress even when they have no waiters here
And now we switching back the flow while we bringing it back
Making music that we love, I'll be singing a track
And anybody get around with a plan to diss us
Rock up late, have you saying, ""Damn, you missed us""

[Chorus: 360]
Woah! Everybody going sick in the crowd
You all know what we're singing about, just get loud
Woah! Make the place jump, go and turn the bass up
If you wanna raise up, everybody say ""Woah!""
Woah! Everybody going sick in the crowd
You all know what we're singing about, just get loud

I got that swish dick, Andrew Gaze's extension
Swan neck on my dick
Yo

[Verse]
I got an elbow on my dick, yeah, an elbow on my dick
When I show it to a girl they're like, ""Hello, what is this?""
And when it talks it says, ""Hello, this is Six""
But you gotta understand, I got a elbow on my dick
Yeah, you mighta seen me in my battles, right?
Mightn't know my tracks, only know me as that battle guy
But see they never get their angles right
Talking 'bout my bent dick, at least it ain't angled right
Hey yo, look at this, Sixty got a crooked dick
Fucked your girl, wouldn't fit, all she did, took the tip
You think I give a fuck, homie? It is metres large
When it comes to winter time, I love it, I don't need a scarf
Eiffel Tower, probably massive as that
And you just want it 'cause it's honestly happy and fat
Gotta be having a crack, but if I say
I'm going on a raging bender then I'm probably having a wank
Slap my elbow, slap my, slap my elbow
Shit is real curvy, looking like a bent cellphone
Stupid bitch, hell no's
Laughing, tickle me: Elmo
Uh, yeah, bitch we are on deck
Got a dick bent, looking like a fucking swans neck
Yo, it's the jump off, you don't like it? Fuck off
Check out my bent dick, Andrew Gaze's jump shot

Yeah, uh uh (What up, 6?)
Yeah, I'm back to get paid
Scratch that, I'm back to entertain
I'ma reverse any misguided
Misconception that's been attached to the name
Like, ""[?] ain't a factor, he's afraid
He don't really spazz on the tracks that he's made""
When I see you fools it's always the same shit
Like ""Justice, when are we gonna collab? You're insane""
I've been a fiend like you can't imagine
[?]
I can see you snakes, and trust it's gonna hurt
When they fall off [?] with no arms to catch 'em, like
I'm Johnny Cash, man, I walk the line
I give a fuck if you sayin' it's before my time
Ayo, a good friend said, ""When you fall, you fly""
(What up, 6?) And now I know what he was tryna say
'Cause even when you think you about to find a way
Success can still feel like it's miles away
Yeah, their ain't another MC in my league
There's only a few dudes I deem fit to beat us
Me, [?] 360, P Easy
All the rest don't mean shit to me
Get a line of that blow and immerse your brain
And this'll blow your mind, call it Kurt Co—caine
There's a feeling my heart's in love wit'
I'm half intrigued, but half disgusted
Half of me's scared to be passin' judgement
'Cause a feelin' that strong, man, it can't be trusted
One half always asks for substance
The other half fiends for that party, club shit
I asked a fan what he wanted to hear
He didn't mind long as this did the last one justice
So here I am, with my heart on my sleeve
Man, it's harder to breathe when you pass the summit
Yo, I first to touch down, last to touch it
Back to where we started, but with half the budget
I could easily've stopped by now
Another dream cut short, but it's hard to just quit
It's how I feel when the party drug hit
Knowin' that I'm on a level that just can't be fucked with
Yo

[Verse 2: 360]
Ayo
Ayo, 60's a loudmouth, yo
(We know) Yeah, you heard me before
Yo, I'm here to make the crowd bounce, though:
Matt Shirvington's balls
Look up 'cause their ain't no limits
Me and Justice'll take no prisoners
""60, that ain't the same flow, is it?""
Mate, it's that dope that it makes no difference
Yeah, so save it all buddy
Let 'em all go 'cause they can talk ugly
But if you wanna battle 'em takin' your money
And when I nearly died it made more hungry
Uh, and I'm way beyond ya
If you got hope then I take it off ya
If God doesn't kill me he makes me stronger
When he fails it takes him longer
I am seen as a mental patient
Try to start fires in petrol stations
I'm here, but the rest are flakin'
They had shine, but, yes, they're fadin'
Now I'm livin' in this entertainment

La la la, la la la, la la la
What you're seeing, what you're seeing
What you're seeing is what you get now
And I'm never stoppin' until I just make you see
What you see is what you get now

[Verse 1]
Hey yo, I try to find a common ground
And I sprint from the start while everyone else is joggin' out
And yo, I got the right plan with a nice fam
All I need is a mic stand in my right hand
I'll do it myself, no need for a hype man
I'm never stoppin', spread my wings in this life span
And I think, as I stare at the sky
""60's not a hip-hop stereotype""
And I dress well, not a derelict guy
For my views, yo, I'm ready to fight
'Cause I always hear the same dudes every year, rapping next to us
The same crew from back then with added extras
And yo, I wanna be part of a scene
But not a part of this scene that needs to part at the seams
You start to believe that I harness the dream
60 ain't my real name but, regardless, it's me

[Chorus]
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
I still believe in myself to get proud
I’ll never let myself fall or step down
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
And I'm never stoppin' until I just make you see
What you see is what you get now

[Verse 2]
Uh, sometimes, it might hurt and
Your eyes try to decide but life's worth it
You might try to find the right person
To help on your way, then you find they're a type burden
Every day, you effect the air and breath you take
And definitive days when your friends are fake
(Nah, I try) I think of what helps
And then uh, sometimes, you gotta think of yourself
But maybe is that selfish? Or maybe not
Maybe we can decipher what made the plot
People forever tryin' to take your spot
If you don't let them, then you're safer
What I wanna do is bring the musical raps
So you know you'll enjoy when you're choosin' a track
In this life, yo, I try to be the odd one out
'Cause you know all the rest you forgot about, let's be honest now

[Chorus]
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
I still believe in myself to get proud
I’ll never let myself fall or step down
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
And I'm never stoppin' until I just make you see
What you see is what you get now

[Verse 3]
Uh, I won't apologise, I dress to impress
'Cause deep down, I'm an approachable, respectable head
You should never forget that I plan to be sincere
'Cause I wanna make the music that my family can hear (ye-yeah)
While turnin' the page, I'm learnin' that hate
Is workin' a stage and cursin' 'til you're certain to break
And I'll sing my favourite song to people who don't know
I'm gettin' hated on for smiling in photos
And, whether rockin' thongs or wearing kicks
I'd rather look porno than dress a bit like a derelict
Because I don't want chicks thinking I'm hardcore
I'd rather have 'em see my face in their heart's core
You want more? You want me to keep going?
While rocking the beats, knowing that honest MCs know him
It's not a disease, no, I'm just on top of my feet
I'm getting dissed but coppin' it sweet, hopin' for more

[Chorus]
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
I still believe in myself to get proud
I’ll never let myself fall or step down
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather 'round as you will witness a story to be told. You will not see me coming, but mark my words, you will feel me inside you, for you are I, and I are you *Laughs Maniacally*

[Ad-Libs]
Fuck yeah
Uh
Uh-ah uh-ah-ah, uh-ah uh-ah ah—ah

[Chorus (Partial)]
Because I'm raising hell
It ain't gonna raise itself
And I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own
It's better the devil you know than the devil you don't

[Verse 1]
You won’t see me the flesh, only ever in the mind (nup)
Which means I’m in the flesh, but it's the head that I’m inside (yep)
You'll never see a better vessel ever been designed (nup)
Everywhere you look you’ll see a devil in disguise (yes)
The mind that I’m inside, yo, I try it on for size (let's go?)
If I’m liking it, then I just might just commit a crime
(Kinda suits me, ayy?) Then rightfully it's mine, if you with ya mates
And hear “Speak of the devil” that means I finally arrived (I'm here)
I might be in ya mind, but I’m dead forever (always)
And if there’s hell to pay then I’m the motherfucking debt collector
(Give me your fucking money) Last year sat on Seth Sentry's deltoids
Helped him write a song called ""Hell Boy""
(You are so full of shit) I’ve never felt joy
And I don’t speak much, the last time I said hello
You heard it in Adele's voice (from the other side)
'Cause of me heavens gates are ruined
If I’m in ya mind then you'll never make it through 'em (nup)
Every time the coppers find a death and they pursue it
Yo, the killers last words were ""The devil made me do it""
But God made earth in seven days, bitch
It's been a pleasure to fuck it up every day since
I’m here to bring a balance to your mental health (yep)
I'll make you feel the worst that you’ve ever felt (I will, I will)
I’m the worst card the earth has been ever dealt
People say I got the Devil smell, scent from hell

[Chorus]
In this body never felt so fly (fly)
Why I'm here? Ain't gonna tell you lies (lies)
But I'm like ""Nah—ah—ah—ah
Nah—ah—ah—ah, bitch, I can't tell you why""
'Cause I'm raising hell (raising, raising hell)
It ain't gonna raise itself (raise it—raise itself)
And I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own
It's better the devil you know than the devil you don't

[Verse 2]
I went motherfuckin' undercover, as an alter boy in the bell choir (yep)
Just to swap all the holy water with hell fire (fire)
I might look like Voldemort but I smell nicer
Lost the plot more than an older author with alzheimers
(Where am I?) I choked out Soulja Boy with a belt, right
Farted on his son then sold his daughter to Al-Qaeda
The advocate, not the devil himself
I was sent here to help, a senator ascended from hell (I'm here)
The opportunity presented itself
I couldn’t say no, 'cause down there is sweaty as... well
I’m why America's wealth's in debt to itself
And Kennedy fell, and nine-eleven as well
They bombing kids aged eleven and twelve and blame a terrorist cell
And never mention all the oil that they gettin' as well
Fathered George Bush, raised him well (yep)
I had him on the right path by the age of twelve (I did)
But I’m ruthless, the motherfucking truth is
When he was fifty-four’s when I really started raising hell (kill 'em)
The devil's never been red before with a set of horns
With a pointy tail and a motherfuckin' metal fork (nah)
You’ve been lied to, everything you’ve ever thought
The devil is the banker with the money funding every war (facts)
When I’m around you’re inclined to write FML
People say I got the Devil smell, scent from hell

[Chorus]
In this body never felt so fly (fly)
Why I'm here? Ain't gonna tell you lies (lies)
But I'm like ""Nah—ah—ah—ah
Nah—ah—ah—ah, bitch, I can't tell you why""
'Cause I'm raising hell
It ain't gonna raise itself
And I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own
It's better the devil you know than the devil you don't

[Spoken]
Now watch all these fucking cunts in Youtube comments say that I'm in the Illuminati and shit, 'cause I started dropping videos on the sixth of the sixth, and the Spotify playlist is Six. ""That means he must be Illuminati."" I fucking wish I was, cunt. Pay off this fucking mortgage

Better the devil you know than the devil you don't

Starry-eyed

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching

[Verse 1: 360]
Ayo, this music shit's a funny game, where people talk and yo
It doesn't change, yo, I feel like walking 'cause it's fucking lame
And I ain't met this bird, she acting like she sorta knew me
'Cause it's a gig, yo, I'ma treat her like some sorta groupie
She got her guard up, something that she has to do
See I understand though, I guess that's what us rappers do
Yo, it's a fact, it's true, go ahead and judge my moves
I'll be honest though, I sometimes do, see
The more you do it though, the more you're gonna need of it
It's all your ego and all it does is feed off it
You find a girl to say your goodnight to
Then say your goodbye's like, ""Yeah, I had a good night too""
Peace

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, my mother's saying I should find myself a nice girl
Ayo, I'm trying to, it's tough to live in my world
Especially if I'm to meet them at a gig
'Cause what's meaningful to them is always meaningless to him
See they're either up for anything or definetly scared off
Or things boring, the infatuation wares off
'Cause in a second they be offering you sex
'Cause of your rep, I ain't expectin' you to get it just respect it
But see it ain't about sexin' 'em all
Most the times I can't see it being anything more
But see I love it and I hate, let the lesson be told
But if I'm only known as 60 I ain't gettin' involved, no

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
Lightning
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed

[Pre-Intro]

[Intro: 360]
Hey yo, it's me myself and I, yeah I'm back again
I played the background watching what's been happening
I never thought, when I was fucking up in school
That this shit would even work, if it doesn't I'll be cool
Even if, for now, I only manage to scrape by
As long as I'm living off of rap, it's a great life
So I'ma take my ways I create this
And take time, cock back and aim at a great height
This is it though, I'd better step forward then
It's a chance to be forever airborne
But I'm never happy with the second best score
While I'm chasing after a dream, I never slept for
Just to get my rap on, talking about whatever I have done
Find believe even when I have none
So fuck it, I'm about to have fun
And not think about this life 'cause we only have one

[Verse 1: 360]
I'm sorry that I'm so late, yo I slept in
You can't blame me, I was having the best dream
I was watching my life up on the big screen
Had the present on pause, flicking to the next scene
It had me and everybody coming together
Sky high while we're running to heaven
Let me take you to a place where it's summer forever
So there'll be no chance in hell of feeling under the weather
But look, I know that I can be whatever I believe
I keep my feet grounded and bring the sky to me
Most people have grown egos
But it's so see through, I'll show that there's no need too
Even go that route
I did it before, but see I know that now
But see I know it's hard, but I laugh in the face of death
While living life on the edge without a safety net, let's go

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Either the sky is falling down
Or that's me flying up again
The sky is falling
I see the sky is falling down
Or they got me going up again
The sky is falling
I'm falling again

[Verse 2: 360]
See I know that it's a fight to the top
And any other day, yo you're likely to flop
Some lies will arise in your eyes and entice you to stop
But the sky is the prize that I want
And how to show my style and to boast my skill
And I don't know how but I know I will
'Cause I have to be the best
It's win win for me 'cause rap relieves the stress
The industry now is in a big crisis
It's innocently down by these kid pirates
And if you listening now and think this shit's fire
Stop being ignorant now, you think it's sick? Buy it
Uh, I understand if you don't buy it
Supporters need the supporters who go find it
But for now I'ma go fly and
I'm so high that you won't find me so don't try it

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Either the sky is falling down
Or that's me flying up again
The sky is falling
I see the sky is falling down
Or they got me going up again
The sky is falling
I'm falling again

[Bridge: 360 & Styalz Fuego]
'Cause, even when I'm falling, I'm flying
The sky is falling
'Cause, even when I'm falling, I'm flying
I know you're trying call me
Down, down (the sky is falling)
Before the sky can reach the ground

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Either the sky is falling down
Or that's me flying up again
The sky is falling
I see the sky is falling down
Or they got me going up again
The sky is falling
I'm falling again

[Outro: Styalz Fuego]
Sky is falling

[Sample]
Was wird daraus? Wenn der Bruno mal tot geht?
Wo landen diese Sachen, wo landen diese Instrumente?
Was wird daraus?

[Intro]
My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now won't budge me
Where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin' in a coffin
I done made it through the pain and the strife
It's my turn now, my world, my might, my light
My life, my life
My life

[Ad-Libs]
Uh-huh
Oi, stand the fuck up, idiot!
Tommy Sixx, bitch
Yeah
Flight so rare, it's too fast, I don't care

[Verse]
Hi, I am off my face
I am happy because life's great
I am usin' the music I do
While refusin' to do any job I hate
And I party like nobody else
And if you ain't down then I'm on my way
Wakin' up on a random couch
Like, ""Who the fuck are you? This is not my place""
I am ready for whatever they bring
If you think you the shit, yo, step in the ring
Competitive as ever, I am everything
And put in energy to never think a negative thing, no
""So why do you call yourself 360?""
""Wanna rap, ayy? Fuck out of my face"" Fuck off
Stop thinkin' you can take my crown
All of y'all should just lay right down
Stop sayin' that I changed my sound
I'm on top of my game right now
Give a fuck if my sound is changin'
You should see the amount I'm savin'
And plus I'm attracted to beats
When you're listenin' in and the ground is shakin'
Watch everybody love my shit
I ain't even on that punchline tip
Bring the haters out, you can hate me now
Guess what? You can suck my dick

[Outro]
'Cause this is my life
This is my life

[Verse 1:]
Here's someone I'd like you to meet – rock bottom
You can hide it sometimes, today is not an option
You want to tell your friends, and you wanna spit it out
It's pretty hard to do, you'd hate to think you'd bring 'em down
But even though you'd want 'em to if they were in need of you
Even though the front is hard to hold, it's still easier
And every day it shows its face, you're getting killed inside
It's so twisted, it's the thing that makes you feel alive
So you can't leave it, it's like you half need it
That inner demon, it makes you want to quit believing
I know how you feel and really, oh, I know it's true
'Cause, honestly, that's exactly what I'm going through

[Hook:]
My wings are broken
My wings are broken

[Verse 2:]
You're in the eye of the storm
Should be glad in a way, that's where lightning is formed
All these clouds that surrounded around you, fighting a war
You've seen this violence before, but you don't know what you're fighting it for
It's so hard to let your heart embrace it
You see it's hard to take it, it's getting larger and you can't escape it
It's like you can't uncover this grey cloud on you
So you sit there, hoping it rains down on you
It'll swallow you whole. You know that that's standard
You see the ground, but it's bound to be a crash landing
You need to be here now, you always go within
You want to touch down, it's hard to do with broken wings
It's like your hearts pain is everything you can't take
Forget about your past days, remember that our scars fade
I know how you feel, talking 'bout it won't do
But you'll be fine that's exactly what I'm going through

[Hook:]
My wings are broken
My wings are broken

[Verse 1: 360]
Hey yo, it's like that
Don't ask, it's like that
If you mofo's question my words I'll fight back an'
Talk flow, I'll hijack your kayak
And with girls I like 'em white-black like Mike Jack
Son, I'm so good, givin' women a hightide
And I defy heights, living the high life
I won't be hopin' that my enemies fail
Because I know that they'll be chasin' at the end of my trail
Def Jam wanted all my raps sent in the mail
So to make sure they felt them I sent 'em in braille
And I'm [?] sendin' 'em text messages
Adrenaline is pennin' then I'll be FedEx'in' 'em
Emos, I'ma pocket knife your fringes
Cut your hair and make you wanna die this instant
Let's be honest, you ain't qualified for fringes
You should get sued for copyright infringement

[Chorus: Joelistics]
Get your hands up, stand up, now
Put your drink down, jump 'round now
Everybody in the place get loud
We ain't stoppin' till the crowd gets down
Get your hands up, stand up, now
Put your drink down, jump 'round now
Everybody in the place get loud
We ain't stoppin' till the crowd gets down

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah, I get my jitters out rappin' to old vets
We headbangers, yo, we actually fold necks
My soul's set on finding some gold
I'm saving my dole cheques and buying a Rolex
And hold up, if you're feelin' this vibe now
We're gettin' pretty messy if you diggin' this live sound
And if you don't wanna drink till it's lights out
Imagine gettin' Johnny and then rippin' his eyebrows out
Everybody wanna party, you're all welcome
Anybody from Port Melbourne to [?]
And the alcohol is takin' over
I gotta drink eight Corona's to make me sober
And even though we got deal we stay savin'
And plan to sell to units like a realestate agent
And when there's money we'll invest in some property
It's either that or gettin' cheques from the lottery
Biatch

[Chorus: Joelistics]
Get your hands up, stand up, now
Put your drink down, jump 'round now
Everybody in the place get loud
We ain't stoppin' till the crowd gets down
Get your hands up, stand up, now
Put your drink down, jump 'round now
Everybody in the place get loud
We ain't stoppin' till the crowd gets down

[Bridge: Countbounce & 360]
Uh, yeah
Countbounce, havin' a strum
Yo, check this out
I paint a cinematic
Vibe without you pressin' play
A thousand hands up
In the air, there's nothing more to say
I paint a cinematic
Vibe without you pressin' play
A thousand hands up
In the air, there's nothing more to say

[Chorus: Joelistics (360)]
Get your hands up, stand up, now (yeah)
Put your drink down, jump 'round now (uh)
Everybody in the place get loud (big up to Joelistics for the beat)
We ain't stoppin' till the crowd gets down (party hard or go home)
Get your hands up, stand up, now (yeah, uh, it's 360)
Put your drink down, jump 'round now (yeah)
Everybody in the place get loud (why come down when you can stay up?)
We ain't stoppin' till the crowd gets down (that's right, that's right)

I feel this for you
I feel this for you
I feel this for you (Ah!)

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah
Hi, I'm from the Generation Y
See they really wanna label us and separate us, why?
Look me in my eyes, we in a better place in time
And fuck what they be thinkin', I'ma never change my mind
Yeah, hear me out, I think livin' in this country's great
But there's a few things this government should fuckin' change
To our soldiers, man, lest we forget 'em
How the fuck are we still warin' when it's twenty-eleven?
Wrong, we move forward, but we take steps backwards
Like those of us who don't believe in same sex marriage
Yeah, this is the modern day segregation
See, I defend and praise 'em, I could give a fuck if you resent and hate them
So if you with me on this track then throw your ones up
And if you racist in this age then grow the fuck up
I'm being real 'cause that's how we do it son
We representin' one race motherfucker, the human one

[Bridge: Alana Stephens]
Oh yeah

[Pre-Verse: Tys]
When you hear this

When you hear this

[Verse 2: Tys]
I play this game, I can see you're tryna break me down
And kill me to fill me with all your hatred and your pain
You ain't gonna take me out, can't throw me or slow me down
Nah, you must me crazy to be thinking I'd let you manipulate me
So come on, I won't give up
You've tried for so long, but they go on 'cause you're not strong enough (Yeah)
Now that's life, pick any one reason if that gives you reason to fight
And stay alive and maybe in time you will find what you seek in this life

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
We all live for the weekend
Just tryna get by
But losing track of time
And we never need a reason
To leave it all behind
There's only one thing on my mind

[Verse 1: PEZ]
Man, you know I tried my luck at a few day jobs
And every single one I had I used to hate on
I swear to God, I'd wake up every morning with a fake cough
Hoping maybe I could get the day off
I knew the safe option was to stay on
Still I couldn't help but muck around till I got laid off
Rapping all day long tryna make songs
Thinking to myself 'I hope this hard work pays off'
So I told my friends ""I'm an emcee""
And they were like ""PEZ, you're a deadbeat"" (yeah)
How're you gonna make the ends meet
Rent's steep, you won't even make it to the next week
And it seemed like
There was a pretty good chance they would be right
But I just kept holding onto my dream like ""Nah
I'm gonna get there in the end, but in the meantime""

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
We all live for the weekend
Just tryna get by
But losing track of time
And we never need a reason
To leave it all behind
There's only one thing on my mind

[Verse 2: 360]
Before rap I was different in a way
Tryna make a living as a chippy in the game
My boss figured out a minimum to pay
He was giving me a wage, I was literally a slave
When's this motherfucka giving me a raise?
I can barely afford to put some dinner on my plate
Spent every day wishing it'd rain
'Cause every time it rains you'd be finished for the day
PEZ told me to give the shit away
""Fuck work, there's something bigger we can chase""
Taught about belief and the difference it'd make
Little did he know I would quit within a day
And while at work I was dreaming (dreaming)
Always thinking 'bout the weekend (weekend)
I couldn't wait till the week ends
And it will end, but until then

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
We all live for the weekend
Just tryna get by
But losing track of time
And we never need a reason
To leave it all behind
There's only one thing on my mind

[Bridge (Extended): PEZ]
In the deep end
On the grind
'Nother weekend
Is on my mind
In the deep end
On the grind
'Nother weekend
Is on my mind

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
We all live for the weekend
Just tryna get by
But losing track of time
And we never need a reason
To leave it all behind
There's only one thing on my mind

[Bridge: PEZ]
In the deep end
On the grind
'Nother weekend

Forthwrizzy son, let's go

[Verse 1: 360 & PEZ]

Yeah, a comfortable style, wonderful smile
You don't like me, you're stuck in denial
Yeah, I walk in the room like ""PEZ is in the room""
Make the most of it people, I'll be exiting it soon
Ridiculous flow, bitch you should know
There isn't anybody better that's why everybody says it

The dude walking the club in the fluro jeans
Yeah, don't even act like you don't know '6
When you go sick that your throats go....
Hearing rude folks boo us
That's like having 2Pac fans in the Ku Klux Klan
Yeah, it doesn't happen because you love rappin'
So much that even if you don't you still go nuts

Yeah, I think I want a figure around eight-hundred-thou'
'Cause I'm getting sick of living in the same fuckin' house

'Cause I want a lot of space when my mates come around

(Yo, yeah)

[Verse 1: 360]
Coming to terms that I might become a blind guy
If I do I'll only ever look on hindsight
Yeah, but if I do lose my eyesight
I don't give a fuck cause I'll be looking through my mind's eye
If there is a God, can I get a life-line?
With my vision now I'm forced to look on the bright side
Feel like my life is a really short timeline
So I smoke on cloud nine, die watching time fly
I've played so many incredible shows
But because I'm so fucked I don't remember 'em though
Fear is an emotion that none of us should be scared of
If you need help, play this and it'll wear off

[Refrain: Daniel Johns]
Don't wanna talk about it baby
It's just a needle in the hay
And I can feel nothing lately
Anytime, anywhere, for anything

We gotta get our shit together
Impossible, Yeah!
We're playing numb to stay strong
We gotta keep ourselves together
Impossible

[Verse 2: 360]
Listen, Yeah
I gave music a wedding ring
And I'm willing to have nothing so I can have everything
Got an A&R calling me a junkie
When he barely even knows me so who is he to judge me?
Yeah, yo I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin'
In a dream I don't have to sleep in to be in
Plus now my budget, probably ain't the best
For a young self-destructive, unhealthy fuck-wit
Alcohol, sex, caffeine and ciggies too
Shit, what haven't I been addicted to?
If you're with me then reach for the sky
Pour a drink and celebrate that we're even alive, yeah

[Refrain: Daniel Johns]
Don't wanna talk about it baby
It's just a needle in the hay
And I can feel nothing lately
Any time, anywhere, for anything

[Bridge: Daniel Johns]
I just wanna feel something baby
Another time, another day (baby)
But it's impossible to change me
Any time, in any way, for anything (baby)

We gotta get our shit together
Impossible, Yeah!

[Intro: 360]
Yeah
(Please be seated! Thank you!)
Yeah
360, ""Pass Out""

[Chorus: 360 & Labrinth]
Yeah, yeah, I'm getting large now
And I'll be winning 'cause I'm in it for the stars now
Went to Sydney, hit up EMI with arms out
Then I told 'em how I'm gonna murder ""Pass Out""
Let it rain, let it pour away
(Yeah) We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

[Verse: 360]
Ayo, I guarantee you suckers that I'm one of a kind
Change your perspective and have you wondering why
I'm being honest when I'm saying that I'm loving my life
If life's a bitch, yo, it's 'cause you ain't fucking her right
(You're pretty loose ayy, 6?) Yeah, mate, I reckon
I'll pass out drunk on the stairway to heaven
These bitches wanna see what making love will get them
Dangerfield shirts; I got a crazy dumb collection
Had these labels in a bidding war
Had to decide that if we're gonna be signed and what figure for
Gotta lock 'em in a figure four, see
But I've gotta make a killing 'cause I can't be fucked living poor
I don't do it 'cause I think it'll sell
I'ma do the same shit if it sits on the shelf
But I gotta go and treat it like a business as well
So if the shit ain't gonna kill it, I'll be kicking myself
Me and Pez are gonna see more and get more
The champ is in the building, go and gimme my belt (Cheers)
A major label ain't the be all and end all
But trust me, motherfucker, I'm convinced that it helps, yo
I don't feel like swapping the flow
Keep doing what I'm doing and I want you to know
That it's a one-way street, but I'm blocking the road
With no choice but to sit there and watch it explode
Yeah, head overseas, man, burn it down
And fly back, watch him fade in a blurry cloud
And if you got a big sister, go and turn it loud
The show's over, so go and put the curtain down (down)
Check your size, bitch, you're below me
If you pouring me a drink, you better pour it slowly
I ain't pouring out liquor for my fallen homies
Nah, I'm pouring out liquor 'cause I'm awesome, blow me

[Chorus: 360 & Labrinth]
Yeah, yeah, I'm getting large now
And I'll be winning 'cause I'm in it for the stars now
Went to Sydney, hit up EMI with arms out
Then I told 'em how I'm gonna murder ""Pass Out""
Let it rain, let it pour away
(Yeah) We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

[Bridge: Labrinth & Tinie Tempah]
Whoa
Whoa-o-o-o-o-o-oh-oh
Whoa
Whoa-o-o-o-o-o-oh-oh
Uh, look at me I've been a cheeky [bastard] man and
Look at all the drama we started, now I'm
In here laying on my back
Saying DJ won't ya gimme one more track

I'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning

[Intro]
I really—I really do love ya mate. I really love ya. I'm really sorry I hit you all the time. I promise it won't happen anymore. I promise you. This is the last time. I'm so sorry
I don't fucking need you! I hate you! You mean nothing to me! Get out of my fucking face!
This is my house, I will do whatever I want!
Get the fuck out of my way!
Don't tell me what to do! Where do you think you're going?! Get back here! Don't walk away from your father!
[?]
[?] I really do love ya mate. I do. Don't tell me what to do, I own this place! You get out!
I hate you!

[Verse]
He was a young kid, tormented and hurt
His father nearly pushed him to the end of the earth
On his birthday, December the third
That day his dad was drunk, couldn't even remember the birth
And he'd wish he'd go on holidays and never return
His whole body was cut up and severed and burned
Used to wake up shaking with an image of dad's face
And how he use to use his body as an ash tray
No one suspected shit, always acting fake
The kid was forced to smile put on a happy face
He used to try and keep his chin high
If he let an ounce of sadness out, he'd see a fist fly
Teachers asked about the bruising and he'd give lies
A kid's mind with no reasoning to live life
A thin line between hate and depression
If it wasn't with his fist, he'd hit his face with a weapon
The thought of suicide, he'd jump a lake in a second
Without him, his mum wouldn't be safe and protected
He often thought of standing up and fighting back
Was too scared, he knew he'd cop another strike and bash
Except for one day, he came home from school
He was about to leave to a mate's home for pool
He heard screams from upstairs in the bedroom
Mum was yelling but it sounded like sex too
He was raping her, cold blooded and fearless
Nobody was near it and nobody could hear it
And why did they deserve this punishment for?
Then he snapped; he couldn't give a fuck anymore
Then he ran to the room, possessed by a demon
Saw her throat seething and her nose bleeding for no reason
She hobbled down stairs, broken her leg
Poured his gin all over his wife, an emotional wreck
And the kid stood in the doorway, eyes darkened and black
The father was smashed, laughing as he start to attack
He ducked the first swing, it didn't connect
Out of nowhere the dad grabbed the kid at the neck
Squeezing his life away, stared in to his eyes, it rained
He didn't show it hurt, he managed to hide the pain
He sat squeezing and screaming and crying
But the kid let him do it and squeeze it in silence
If he kept going, he would dead him for sure
Then his grip let loose, he flopped next to the floor
And the mum stabbed him in the back with a kitchen knife
Ripped inside screaming in pain, ready to give her life
He saw his mother on the tiles of tears
It was the first time he'd seen his mum smile in years

Da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da
Da da da da da da

[Verse 1]
Most people wanna say something but it takes 'em, a day, you see
I'll tell you 'bout somethin' taken away from me
See I've forgiven people makin' mistakes
But different places they were basically just changing their face
I can't imagine living life with no control
And blocking all feelings in your heart frozen cold
Living fake is something you can't undo
And you've lived it so long that it becomes you
For no reason all the hate made it so wrong
But you can only hold a brave face for so long
The brave face soon turns into an evil one
It's like the wind changed took away your peace and fun
Dig deep past the front and you'll start to yell
Shit I know, yo it's hard as hell to ask for help
But me, I'm coming with the welcoming mat
Even if you think I'm, weak I put myself in a track
See, if I have emotions then I'm coughin' em up
Over years and years, you dudes bottle em up
There's no wonder you don't hesitate to fight a dude
It's the only way you let out what's inside of you
You can call me weak for having an emotional track
But you're more of a pussy because you're holding it back,
You always talk about the bloodshed,
The only reason you don't cry is 'cause you don't want your boys to see you're upset
You're scared they'll laugh taunt and belt you
If they were your real friends they'd fucking help you
Then behind closed doors, you let your dough poor
And let it all out and cry till your throat's sore
See if I'm feeling down like what everyone fears
I'm not afraid to let it out if anyone hears
If I had the power, I'd change you to the old you
And take away all the people that control you
You're in denial and you're stuck in a binge
You don't think for yourself, you're just a puppet on strings
I know you're insecure motherfucker, just think
Why else would a song like this get under your skin?

[Hook]
You're so fake (yeah) you're so fake (uh)
You're so fake, why can't you be yourself? (why not?)
You're so fake (huh) you're so fake (listen)
You're so fake, you're never gonna be yourself

[Verse 2]
Honestly, fuck taking my time
Yo, I'm after the spotlight and I'm making it mine
And I had the haters claim that I was faking my rhymes
But I've left that shit behind, fuck saying goodbye
Because I love hip-hop but I hate the Australian type
A bunch of meatheads acting all crazy in fight
Yo, I'm brave enough to say what I say on the mic
On some real shit, I'm staying that way till I die
Optimistic and I place all the hate to the side
Hate these days, always patiently waiting inline
I know I shine but it's making me blind
There's heaps of beats to destroy and paper to find
You're all caught in an image ashamed when you cry
I'd rather cry then have my face imitate a disguise
It's like I'm always being faced with these lines
It ain't my life but you say that it's mine
I used to take it in stride, wish I talk with Australian pride
But I hate this country, I hate what you like
Superficial, highstrung, protencious and fake
The fucked thing is ninety percent will never relate

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, have a think about that one
If you think it's about you then it probably is
That one was meant to be taken to heart
Yeah, 360, Pabstrakt, what?

[Verse 1: GMC]
Running from my gravity, getting high on the low-low
She never smoked so this her first time riding this coco
Pilot to the island, tropical weather is oh so
Perfect, in a dream state, and I can't even see straight
Smoke up in the apart-e-ment, setting off the alarm again
And we living this life with no consequence, the game we playing, there are no benches
Slo-mo in that greyscale like a movie picture or magazine
Eyes low when I'm deep in it, I'm wide awake, I never had a dream
Feel this realer, even be this vivid
Baby, look up in the sky to see the life I'm living

[Chorus: GMC]
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home

[Post-Chorus: GMC (360)]
And we high and we fly when want to
And we roll and we go where we want to
And we ain't gon' take nobody else, you ain't gotta worry 'bout
Anything when you're this high (Yo)

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, I am everything you really hate, genuinely feeling safe
Don't forget to take your pills today
You got that medicine to heal the pain
You know those chemicals'll kill your brain
Kids are taking ecstasy to feel awake
And little girls are getting pregnant like it is okay
But it isn't, mate, do that shit on a different day
Now with the methamphetamines and the ketamine is streetbound with no shit to chase
Now, who am I to talk and who am I to y'all?
I paint the line I walk 'cause life is short till lyin' in chalk
Does it matter the time, just stop
We making that music that's timeless, watch

[Chorus: GMC]
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home

[Post-Chorus: GMC]
And we high and we fly when want to
And we roll and we go where we want to
And we ain't gon' take nobody else, you ain't gotta worry 'bout
Anything when you're this high

[Verse 3: Daniel Merriweather]
Fighting my demons 'cause they'll never leave me
Alone
They trying to keep me but reality's holding
[?]
The devil keeps calling me, but I never answer
The phone
Now we speak different languages, so all he can hear is
The tone
I was flying on the highest, flying on the highest
Altitude that's possible to be
They be wearing their disguises, wool over their eyelids
And now it's impossible to see
Forgot about the times we had
I tore apart the boarding pass (flight canceled)
Denying the hand and the card that they dealt you
The eye of the storm is just looking right past you
Flight note: flight canceled
Flight note: flight canceled

[Chorus: GMC]
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home

[Verse 1: 360]
We might have lost control
See the writing's on the wall
See 'em all try to hide it from us all
But we might've lost it all
And we need to see the light
I see all the people read the signs
Don't know how to read between the lines
We gotta heal this planet
That's the way that I feel about it
It seems that we're gonna kill it now
But how you expecting to live without it?
Some say we're in code red
Some say they're thinking that it can't stop
I don't think that it might go wrong
At this rate I'm thinking that it can't not

[Hook: Bright Young Things]
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive

[Verse 2: 360]
It—it ain't about global warming
That—that ain't the only warning (warning)
It's about the road we on
We gotta figure out what's most important
It ain't about a total score and
It ain't about us owning more things
If only we could go beyond our overall
I wonder when we might realise
Stop believing these real lies
At this rate that we kill and we fight
I'm wondering, ""will we survive?""
See? This is the scene of the crime
We need to be bleeding it dry
Where evil is winning and people
Are dying and pleading to keep me alive

[Hook: Bright Young Things]
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive

[Bridge: 360]
Yo, I'm thinking it's time we left
'Cause not much time is left
And I don't want to die just yet
'Cause I know a lot of life is left
And I'm needing to find my breath
Right now, we're reaching the final steps
Soon enough, you're going to find me dead
With no one taking the time of death

[Hook: Bright Young Things]
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside

[Verse 1: 360]
The shit is pear-shaped, this is a final straw
You had a good thing goin’, look at this life of yours
Yo, we’ve lost the plot, what are we fightin’ for?
We need to come together, but they divide us more
I’ve been at rock bottom, it’s cold and nothin’s there
I know you must be scared but it’s only up from here
It’s time to knuckle down and get a handle on it though
‘Cause anytime you fail that becomes a chance for you to grow
Make the hatred that you hear from your Satan disappear
From that devil on your shoulder to an angel in your ear
And grab life by the horns and never stumble through
When they say dream on, that’s exactly what you fuckin’ do

[Pre-Chorus: Teischa]
I hope things will come
Together, 'cause I’m
Runnin’ out of ways to go and I’m under
Pressure

[Chorus: Teischa]
‘Cause I’m tryna find a way out
But there’s somethin’ in the way now
But I’m not layin’ down, layin’ down, layin’ down
For nothin’, keep on runnin’

[Verse 2: 360]
You need to show 'em you can do it, you got somethin' to prove
'Cause if you lost everythin' that means there's nothin' to lose (uh)
When you finally believe that it's a blessin' just to feel
They say you can't, that just reaffirms you definetly will
(Yeah, you will) It's your time, it's all right, remember that
Shake off [?] that dust now, what you once had you'll get it back
Never thinkin' what you coulda been, what you shoulda been
'Cause you never listened when they told you what you couldn't be
It's time to leave and climb up the wall
And when you reach the top don't be frightened to fall
You can't believe it while you're speechless at the height of it all
Don't be afraid, just admire it more, you found a way out

[Chorus: Teischa]
‘Cause I’m tryna find a way out
But there’s somethin’ in the way now
But I’m not layin’ down, layin’ down, layin’ down
For nothin’, keep on runnin’

[Post-Chorus: Teischa]
And I’m not layin’ down, layin’ down, layin’ down
For nothin’
No, I’m not layin’ down, layin’ down, layin’ down
For nothin’, keep on runnin’

[Bridge: 360]
I know this ain't even really where you wanna be
Ain't no reason you should give 'em an apology
Let go, let go
Let go, let go
I know this ain't even really where you wanna be
Ain't no reason you should give 'em an apology

Go to an orphanage, kicking the door in
Kidnap her like [?] strangle her with my foreskin
Yeah, and I'm swimming with dolphins
It's the only way left to release endorphins
I'm on a motherfucking galaxy quest
I'm trying to figure out which planet's the best
Hey yo, I bet that Saturn is next. It makes sense too
That's why I got the motherfucking tat on my neck
Went to the bank to make a balance request
They couldn't understand, all the cash that I've spent
And, if I don't change soon, I won't have any left
Now, even my god damn reality check bounced
Not another fucking rapper again
Kicking me another verse about his pad and his pen
Asking me when me and Kerser fucking battling next
I'm sorry buddy but that ain't going to happen again
No, I ain't scared that I'll damage or wreck
But no cunt will ever go and piggyback me again
Brother, don't take it as a lack of respect
I'm glad I helped you [?] a tad of success
But I just have to adress something that has to be said (What?)
A snapped neck doesn't need snapping again
Do I think I won the battle? Actually, yes

'Cause, really, how many of his bars do you actually get?

[Verse 1]
There's certain things that make me angry
Like almost having car accidents with a crazy taxi
Or letting 'em in front and they don't wave to thank me
(Oi, mate) (I hate you)
And it's like when you're chillin' at the best party
And these dudes rock up like they're a flex army
No surprise at all, they're rockin' Ed Hardy
([?] bounce [?]) (I hate you)
Or, or when you see a bunch of wasted lads
And they ain't wearin' shit except the Australian flag
I wonder if it comes built in with racial slags
(Oi, mate) (I hate you)
Or when you go into your mate's house in middle-December
He lives one stop away and this is minimal effort
Then you get off and run into some ticket inspectors
(Um... from Sydney)

Then you head home with someone you've slept with once
And then you're so nervous that you can't get it up
(Just work [?]) (I hate you) Uh
You want my mate in the bedroom, wanting him to sex you
Saying be quick 'cause your boys in the next room
Then you crack it 'cause none of us'll respect you, no
(Bitch) (I hate you) Uh
Yo, bitch, you were so thick, oh shit
Those lips you bought have you looking like a blowfish
And you could prob'ly knock me out with those tits
(Hats, boobs, bangers, chest pumped, dang) (I hate you)
And when I'm in a club dancin' with a beer
And a dude comes up and starts rappin' in my ear
Wanna know what I think like I actually can hear

Ayo, I'm cool with a homeless dude bumming some change
But if I say that, ""I'm sorry, I got nothing to pay""
And then you're pissed off up in my face like you got something to say
(I hate you) And, uh

Dude, don't go thinking that it's my shout
Now you're acting like I'm paying for your night out
(Cheap fuck) (I hate you)

Give her anything, can't wait for the next day
Argh, the whole time she's using you for your best mate
(Mate) (I hate you)
Uh, my mate slept with a girl and he tried to hit the exit
Six months later, she was kinda gettin' hectic
Didn't know he was the guy she was obsessed with
Kept him there the whole time lying she was pregnant

I pray for the ones that have killed them
I pray, but I don't know who to pray to
Help me to understand

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah
It’s like hate’s been popularised
Love turns to hate at the drop of a dime
I’ve seen my own fans crossin’ a line
But if they’re fans of hate, I don’t want ‘em as mine
It’s got me confused, yo, I’m not gonna lie
I've got Muslim friends, they don’t want me to die
They ain’t tryna build a mosque to provide
A place where they can go and build bombs and to hide
Look, a burka is not a disguise
It’s foreign to you, so it’s a shock in your mind
All you need to do is spend some quality time with ‘em
To know they just wanna live a positive life
See, that’s the nature of human kind
In a life they just [?]
They see a war goin’ on and they wanna survive
And not see their whole family get hospitalised
It’s got ‘em thinkin’ everythin' that Islam is
Where every Muslim's a terrorist, a Jihadist
And every Westerner is a target
But look at ISIS, America is who armed ‘em
And they plantin’ the seed of the fear in the street
So when you see a man with a beard you retreat
Got you scared of a face full hair, but what’s makin’ him
Ain’t what he wears it is really beneath
I understand though, we have to discuss it
All the progress is actually nothin’
We wanna live in peace, but the shit in the middle east
Is still goin’ on where the acts are disgusting
If you ever raise a fact on the subject
All we ever do is attack and get upset
If you wanna evolve and help the problems to solve
Stop bickerin’ and have the discussion
What a joke, people killin’ each other
Over a book, and they suffer a lot for land
I love some of the scriptures, but fuck a religion
‘Cause I’m suddenly thinkin’ that I’m askin’

[Chorus: Gary Clark]
Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God is Man
Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God
The trouble with God

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah, the scriptures are full of lots of knowledge
But I feel like it’s misunderstood
It’s easy to misjudge a book
When people start killin’ in it’s name, then it did nothin’ good
I’m not saying that I’m right at all
I’m just speakin’ my mind, I wish others would
But it grew from a cult to a big brotherhood
Where you do what you’re told though, ‘cause big brother looks
As far as religion’s concerned
I hate to see the innocent's hurt
Hundreds of years of abuse towards kids in a church
And still Islam is considered the worst?
We can’t go back, the damage is done
Compassionate is what we have to become
I don’t blame all the catholics for what was actually done
You don’t taint a whole group for the actions of some
Instead of worshiping a power that’s higher
We need to understand that the power’s inside us
The hours in time are allowed to remind us
Any goodness within you, allow it to guide ya
If I’m wrong, then I trust He’ll forgive
Everything I say comes from love from within
Stop lookin’ down on others who sin
And if you do believe in God, leave the judgement to Him

[Chorus: Gary Clark]
The trouble with God
The trouble with God
Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God is Man
Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God
The trouble with God

[Bridge: Gary Clark]
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Outro: 360]
What I’m sayin’ isn’t definite, right
I ain’t sayin’ what you fed was a lie
These are the thoughts that I get in my mind
And for me, I just can’t go accept that it’s right
The core to religion’s fundamentally right
And the Bible might work as a general guide
But a story that’s told over centuries
Surely it's eventually gonna get embedded with lies

[Reversed Audio: 360]
I just can’t go accept that it’s right
These are the thoughts that I get in my mind
And for me
I just can’t go accept that it’s right
These are the thoughts that I get in my mind
And for me

Ground up!

[Verse]
Yo
I'm disliked 'cause I’m clean cut, I don’t even seem rough (nup)
All this hate fuckin' shits me like this scene does
I'm as real as you, rappin' is my life
But I smile in my pictures 'cause I'm happy I’m alive (I am)
When rap started, it was meant to be the positive sound
These days, it's gone the opposite route
And I rap like a bully, you act like a pussy
So-called veterans but you rap like you're rookies
Fair enough, to drop an album, you will take your time
But you’ve been workin' on your album since like eighty-nine
I was gonna take years, yeah, maybe five
But that ain't takin' time, that’s a fuckin' waste of time (uh)
A whole album of your flows flippin' syllables
Quick to hate others when your own shit is pitiful (wack)
Why don't you try and be your own individual?
Everything you stand for is so hypocritical
You hate on us because of photo shoots
But when you pose to look hard, they're called photos too
And if you're poor, evil and rough, the scene'll love yours
But get commercial media love then you're done for
I'll pay you dudes respect when I actually feel your music
You want to know we smashing and rapping in here? The youth is
Call us pathetic, I'll tell you what pathetic is
This whole scene's topic range is always something negative
Yo, the girls like us, we dress with impressive taste (what?)
They hate you, you dress to impress your mates (true)
I went for it when I looked at the risk
I got balls, jumped up and dissed the Hoods at a gig
Now a bunch of dudes, when they see me, really want to break my jaw
But the hood status is exactly what I’m aiming for
And now these tough emcees want to see me fuckin' bleed
It wasn't a threat, that line was only tongue in cheek (fuck)
This scene is hard to find the energy for
This is heart on the sleeve rap, leave the rest at the door
And I lost a fan base just like never before
I've been shunned 'cause I ain’t workin' with Trem anymore
I was stoked to be down with the Lyrical Commission
That style wasn’t me though, I was innocently driven
And watch you run and say that '60 went and dissed them
That ain’t a diss, you dumb-arse, it's a difference of opinion
It takes a man to admit it, yo, it wasn't me
I love that raw style but honestly, it's not for me
It ain’t me, yeah, you can’t hate me
'Cause I love Lord Finesse but I'd rather listen to Jay-Z
So if someone hates me, they react physically
I wonder why? They can’t fuck with me lyrically
And you can hate me 'cause I’m singin' on tracks
But if you got a problem, then come and bring it on wax

[Outro]
I'll burn you, yeah
That was to anyone, I’m fuckin' over it
Someone

[Verse 1: 360]
Yo, I wanna know how you feel man
What you think you a real man
What about your children
This shit right here's gonna kill them
Thought she married a goody
But she married a bully
Fuck that, yo she married a pussy
A real man never puts his hands on a woman
No way is it okay, whether male or female it goes both ways
It doesn't matter who's the higher rate
You never touch somebody in a violent way
You're so alone though, you might die if you don't go
See it's hard to take, you can't escape
It's like you're imprisoned in your own home
One second you get a nice kiss
The next you might get a right fist
It could be any night
You knew he had a temper
But never like this
What a monster he's turned into
Now mentally you're turning too
It's not just hurting you
If you don't leave know he might murder you
You thought you were gonna be great
Now you wanna escape
But you're scared as shit
You're afraid of the dark
And the darkness right now is where you live
You don't need to be brave
Stop leaving it be
Your kids are the reason you stay
But they need to be the reason you leave
That's it you've got to leave
I hope they don't understand what they see
And if they do understand
Then I hope they view him as what not to be
I believe it's time for peace
Here's some words a wife will need
You got to know that abuse is the issue
As soon as he hits you its time to leave
Never knew he was crazy as this
Feel so trapped no escaping this shit
It ain't about taking a hit
He'll say anything just to make you forgive
No apology will ever change what he did
Can't ever take back braking your ribs
You gotta do it for the sake of the kids
So they know it ain't cool to be raising their fist

[Hook: 360]
It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them
It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them
It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them
It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them

[Outro: Sia (sampled)]
Ouch I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah I think that I might break
I've lost myself again and I feel unsafe
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, enfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, enfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me

[Chorus 1]
They always fantasise on stepping up
But see, I understand, I know why
But you can go ahead and get prepared
But acting like you're never scared, buddy, don't lie
'Cause see they always coming up to me
They tryna find a angle but go ahead and just dig away

[Verse 1]
But what I'm saying is to dig your grave
'Cause coming up against 360, you better get afraid
You're gonna leave here with more than just your ego bruised
You'll kill yourself, or come close like that Keynote dude
You retarded losers, you ain't got the heart to do it
See I've been ninja fighting, yo, I got the scar to prove it
You a pussy, I can tell when I look at you
And keep on saying what you want because I'm bulletproof
And what that means is that you can't get a bullet through
Honestly, if I was you then trust me, yo, I wouldn't shoot
Yo, you can try and risk it, but you will die from this shit
And we will film the whole thing so you can find a witness
I see him trying, I don't know the reason for it
I guess they wanna die, either that or seem important

[Chorus 2]
Yo, you can go toe-to-toe with me
And I'ma kill you while I look you in the eye
I ain't even gonna try
And you ain't even got a chance, no
And you can go away and train for years
But my advice is you probably shouldn't try
Or else you're gonna die

[Verse 2]
Yeah, homie, I can be prepared, yeah
I can do it all with people there
Faggot, yo, I ain't afraid, keep giving your evil stare
You see the people placing judgement, I control them dudes
You see the crowd that keeps surroundin', I control them too
You must be stupid, you expecting to win
I'm in the best mind-frame that I have ever been in
Yo, I'm a killer, yo, this is me confessing my sins
And, yo, I've mastered this, so, homie, let the lessons begin
And some have said that I've been beaten but it's still not true
Go and gimme anybody, yo, I will not lose
That ain't arrogance, it's confidence, so go ahead and try, bro
But break a leg, motherfucker, I hope you die slow

[Chorus 3]
It's the need to succeed, so you gonna die
They call police, 'cause of 3 and his homicides
They wanna be what they see and they wanna fight
But, yo, I gotta give respect because they wanna try
So let it just be known, if you stepping you will
Definitely go up to Heaven or they're sending you below
I should probably leave these centipedes alone
While they hearing this noise while I'm stepping on their home, like

[Bridge]
Uh, yeah, yeah
That's the noise of me picking up a building and throwing it to the sun type shit
Or having my way with the limousine and not calling it back
Motherfucker, uh

It's Tommy Sixx
Jungle Jimmy cunt
What's good cunt?
Let's fuckin' get it cracking cunt

[Verse 1]
Do you feel what I say? (I do) 'Cause I say what I feel (Whoo!)
I'm high as fuck without takin' a pill (sober!)
Not aimin' for a killing but I'm aimin' to kill
Won't say no that I'm makin' a mil'
Plenty of fish so I aim for gills (straight for the gills)
I start rolling, arsehole with my arms folded
Mark Holden, say something that ain't nothing, my heart's cold as
[?] anybody want it, they're like ""hell no""
I just want to know if Adele wrote ""Hello"" doing hard times on the cellphone

[Bridge (sampled)]
They ask me what's my goal, then they like ""what the fuck""
'Cause I don't want the crown, for me, that's not enough
Yo, I can see the future, I'm the best that's ever livin'
And I've got four years, that's twenty-twenty vision

[Verse 2]
Bent dick's what I'm known for (Yep), bagged a ten since '04 (Yep)
She see the D she like ""no more"", then she feel the tip she like ""No, more!"" (Ha)
I'm so raw, you don't wanna be the one to know more
They turn it out, go work it out, I got a perfect house, no floors
Three-Six-Oh the name brand, check it while I rain-dance
I yearn for the moot, head first in the bush, faceplant
Findin' yourself is like findin' your keys
Find the best tits and you sign them and leave
If you be cold and you're likely to freeze
Hug on my dick 'cause it's ninety degrees
(I hope you actually get that) I had to redefine peace of mind
(Whaddup?) Kidnapped DJ Khaled just to key his ride
That's another one, anybody wanna get into it
Yo, they never do it 'cause they fuckin' run, won't stop till we number one
I gotta shout your mum ('sup babe) yo, that's my favourite lover
(She is) 'Cause, when we fuck, we like to do it like we hate each other
(Take it bitch!) I'm on a beast mode tip, I got the cheat code, bitch
Go find the best porn star, tell her to deep throat this
(Deep throat this, babe) See you don't know how big my ego is
Yo, I might travel the world now that's an ego trip
I'm on fire, I don't have to warm up
Yo. I thought that Instagram was an app to score drugs, go

[Outro]
Yeah
So, I might be sober and off all the drugs and all that shit, but

P Easy, Please Be seated

[Verse 1: 360]
I feel that something inside
Right when you feel there was nothing inside
I know now that it's somethin' this time
Now I feel ready, I got nothing to hide
Yo, it's funny things come when you least expect it
Right when you're just about to reach the exit
And now you're hoping that these people get this
And those who admire will at least respect it
See, a lotta wanna watch you fall
Why the hell they wanna stop you for? You don't have to though
They wanna see you drop the ball
Now they got you thinkin' ""What's it for?"" It doesn't matter though
I write while inside I bleed
Got a hang on every word that your timeline reads
'Cause I'm cool with the life I lead
If you wanna follow suit, yo, it's fine by me

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
Feel like a star [?]
I feel like a star tonight
Without warning
We gave up the ghost inside

[Verse 2: PEZ]
Yeah, yeah [?]
I was focused on my destination
While thinking ""I can get there!"" with an exclamation
[?] all my first attempts to make it
Were just clouded by hesitation
Had to sit down thinkin', find my style
Couldn't fix that quick, had to bide my time, this time I
Won't let that bit of me talk negative
To ensure I never repeat that lesson
Now I won't wait, no way, gotta make my own way
Sometime soon or it's done, I'm through with it
Shit, I'm too close to the finish
To burn out, turn 'round and pack up, are you kidding?
I won't let that happen, no chance, won't even
Think of backtrackin', nah, there's just no time
And I prove it, I can free the ghost in me
I think it's time I start living where I'm sposed to be

I don’t really plan for the future
I just wanna sit around and dance to the music
Hold hands, romance under moonlit stars
And get a bit of a buzz and a few spliffs
I wanna feel the vibe, wanna come alive
And get sweaty having sex in the summertime
‘Cause I don’t wanna die regretting that I
Let it slide instead of me trying whatever I liked, uh
But some people got it all backwards
They needa live a little more like it all matters
Take a day off, and do whatever makes you smile
Quit work and get away for a while, huh
Spend a little time on yourself
And I promise you will definitely find that it helps, so
Make the most of every single moment
Now ‘cause at any given minute it’ll be over

It’s a little hard but you fight it regardless

I never had this? What if I never gave it a shot
Or went at it with everything that I got, uh
‘Cause I don’t wanna work for a livin’
If it isn't what I love, what’s it worth even livin’?
I’m on a mission to pave a path out of my passion
And so far, so good, no lookin’ backwards
I gotta say the bright lights are attractive
But one day, that’ll fade to black and that's it
So I gotta make the most of now
And hopefully I can grow to be the poster child
Haha, I’m just livin’ my life, yo

Uh, I've spent a lot of time working over the past years
Turning sober, bourbon over the last beer
Intoxicated, contemplating in conversation
Lose my feet, chopping, changing my occupation
Not today though, too many hours choking hard
I finished work at five and head straight to the local bar
With open arms while I'm talking to the mates I see
They ain't my real friends but they suffer the same as me
We just drown our sorrows as we waste our green
Pretend we're having fun but really yo it's make belief
It makes me see as I drink to myself
I'll buy you drinks cause I'd rather that than drink by myself
And I had a dream too
I wanted my passion
But through lack of support I chose a job that's relaxin'
And I regret it now, why not follow my dreams for?
I'm another robot but yo I should have been more

[Hook]
It's just the subtle way of suicide (suicide)
Life ain't worth livin inside this blurred vision
It's just the subtle way of suicide (suicide)
I'm drinking away while sitting in pain
It's just the subtle way of suicide (suicide)
Yeah, I should have been more and work for my dreams more
It's just the subtle way of suicide (suicide)
Yo it's the only way out, uh

Yo, I remember bein' raised on what real life is
I've got a wife, kids, a job and still feel like shit
Yeah I've got a job, but I want more cause who wants
Responsibilities for shit you don't have love for
And even though I chop and change every job's the same
I'm gonna try to raise my kids the way I wasn't raised
And yeah I know I've got a great son
But if I haven't had a happy life then how can I create one?
And in their teens not be ashamed to say they love their dad
And not think of their childhood as something bad
And understand why I'm not something great
It's cause I work in a job for years that I fuckin' hate
I could have been something, had the crazy skills
Now all I work for is drinking it to pay the bills
And for my son if you follow your dreams but die
Don't worry it's the best thing at least you tried
And it's the subtle way of suicide

See a lot of them have played to death

See you gonna wanna change directions
They be second but don’t place me next to them

And I'll never drop some catchy lines that
All my fans could rap along with (Never)
You probably think I'm sad and whatnot
But those who know me know I love carryin' on
Just last week I went to Katie Holmes' vacation home
Then camped out the front yellin', ""Marry me, Tom!""
Well, that's a lie, but I did steal their family dog (Uh-huh)
And then I tried to ransom it off (Yeah)
That's not true either, but I'm happy a lot
I just don't make songs 'bout the candy shop
I've never snatched a watch or carried a Glock
I've never bashed or robbed or acted the boss
You won't catch me off on some arrogant pop star shit
My album might flop, hell, bring it right on

Songs that all the
Kids can sing along
With
And I'm sorry if
We wrote the tune

And yeah, I could write and sing all the same stuff as James Blunt
Pack out stadiums with ladies and get paid tons (I could)
But I keep it raw like Tame One's [?]
Flip it back and forth like Forthwrite all night
And we could climb the charts till I'm pickin'
Lobster meat out my teeth with my least favourite ARIA
Without goin' ""La—di—da—di—da, la—di—da—di—da""
Soundin' like we're tryna party hard at the Mardi Gras
Kanye tried and looked awfully stupid
Look at him now, he's gettin' bored of music
Next thing he'll probably put out a porno movie
And even then I bet the bitch'd have autotuning

[Interlude: Smizzy]
""Glad you got Kanye [?] that good, that good, that good""
""Oh, Mr Fishstick""

[Chorus: Joyride]
We don't write catchy
Songs that all the
Kids can sing along
With
And I'm sorry if
We wrote the tune
[?] stuck in your head
Just ignore it

[Verse 3: 360]
Uh
What's the definition of catchy? (I don't know)
Is it some'in' that's repetitious and happy? (Yep)
Yeah, you can bet I'm killin' my cabbie
If he plays catchy shit, but I never been in a taxi (I haven't)
I don't get down with beautiful tune shit
And I fuckin' hate musical music (Fuck)
I wanna slap any dude that'll do this
If you got talent singin' don't use and abuse it
Some call it hate, some call it jealousy
Music's so great as long as there's no melody
And anytime it sticks in my head
Is the only time I wish I was dead, ""Can you kill me?"" (Please)
I hate everything that Nova plays
Even ""The Festival Song"" is overplayed (Ha ha)
It's enough to make me go insane
And there's too much catchy shit, here we go again, like

[Chorus: Joyride]
We go write catchy
Songs that all the
Kids can sing along
With
And I'm sorry if
We wrote the tune
That's stuck in your head
Just ignore it

[Outro: Joyride]
Just ignore it
If it's stuck in your head
Yeah, yeah
If it's stuck in your head
Just ignore

[Intro: 360]
Yeah
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1: 360]
All these jealous motherfuckers are old now
Sayin' don't rap and go back to my old sound
(Buy my old shit, mate) And people sayin' I've sold out
Yeah, man, I have when I'm performing to a whole town (Woo)
Yo, it ain't true
You work a nine-to-five that you fuckin' hate for the money, what does that make you?
The difference is that I'm in love with this shit
And I'm doing me, fuck what you think (Get 'em, 60)
Ayo, I aim high, never low, they try gettin' close
If they ain't gettin' with what I say I let 'em go
Wait, hide, then explode
You see me take flight, an insane height, you want it? Then come and get a dose
I hear 'em talk but honestly all that realness bores me
I went my own path, I knew I'd kill it surely
Those who used to hold the crown in this field before me
They're the same motherfuckers who now kneel before me ([?] bow down)

[Chorus: 360]
Here's a toast to living in the life I chose
Heaven knows it's the one that chose me
Nothing comes free when you're hungry
Staring down two roads trying to get the money
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream

[Verse 2: 360]
My brain's kind of fried, gimme a sec
It's been about five weeks since I been in my bed
I work, I can't recall the last minute I slept
I ain't running from 5-0 but I'm resisting arrest
I can't sleep until I'm the best
I will when I'm dead, I took that in a literal sense
And while the rest of you just sit on the fence
I'm starting point guard, go and give a kiss to the bench
Hey yo, in hip hop, you get props
The second that you let 'em see your shit's pop, they're pissed off
""Keep it real"" and piss off
Thought of every goal I wanted
Wrote a list of all my biggest dreams now every one of 'em's ticked off
Hey yo, I can't look at life on the bright side
The only hours I leave home is at night time
I'm an emcee, no care, stress free
Needed no one to accept me, except me

[Chorus: 360]
Here's a toast to living in the life I chose
Heaven knows it's the one that chose me
Nothing comes free when you're hungry
Staring down two roads, trying to get the money
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream

[Outro: Sam Bruno]
Carry on, carry on in your world
Cause I'm on, cause I'm on to my dreams
Carry on, carry on in your world
Cause I'm under my dream
Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers
Here's to my dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Here's to my dreams

[Chorus]
This is my world (uh)
Music's my girl (yeah, '60)
Now I can chase it
So time isn't wasted
I got something to prove
Baby
Nothing to lose (Uh)
Baby
And they might give hate
And get in your way
You shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause I got something to prove
Baby (yeah)
Nothing to lose
Baby (uh, uh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
When I started this album the pressure was on
Couldn't have nothing weak, it better be strong
And I know that I got some incredible songs
And I could never outdo ""The Festival Song"", wrong
See I know that it's all upstairs
But why did I have to go and crawl up there?
People saw me as a hype man for PEZ
Thought I'd quit rap to be a hype man instead
And they ask ""Why is PEZ always getting shine?"" (Getting shine)
I'm like, ""It's all good, yo, it's PEZ's time""
He deserved it, apart from the beats that we murdered
The time all for me, it was worth it (Worth it)
It feels good to have a major label
They warned us, ""Don't ever let the major change you""
And now you're thinking we could probably change the game, dude
And honestly I'm thinking the same as they do

[Chorus]
This is my world
Music's my girl
And now I can chase it
So time isn't wasted
I got something to prove
Baby
Nothing to lose
Baby
And they might give hate
And get in your way
You shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause I got something to prove
Baby
Nothing to lose
Baby

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah
It took a while, but I found my feet
Found a producer with the sound I need
And now I'm me with something to prove
It's all 3' with nothing to lose (yeah, uh)
So I could grow and in time we both change
And do my own thing, and find my own way
And people thought it could be a curse
But now I know we're gonna get the push it deserves
I don't wanna live up in my head anymore
And I won't be out walking the fence anymore
Now I ain't out tryna impress anymore
I don't wanna be compared to PEZ anymore (anymore)
But I know that there's things we can teach one another
We ain't out tryna compete with each other
Now you seeing I got something to prove
It's all '60 with nothing to lose, bye

[Chorus]
This is my world
Music's my girl
And now I can chase it
So time isn't wasted
I got something to prove
Baby
Nothing to lose
Baby
And they might give hate
And get in your way
You shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause I got something to prove
Baby
Nothing to lose
Baby

Yeah, cheers for coming out

[Intro]
Slow it down

[Verse 1: 360]
Uh, I'm here to talk about love
A certain feeling when you walk with a buzz
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout the person, yo, it's more than enough
I'll be upfront, I'm kind of scared of falling in love
It's the falling part, I'm scared of being caught and then stuck
Inside of her mind kind of design with no control
Walking in with everything and leaving with a broken soul
All hope's revolve around you try to see in hindsight
Nothing else matters now, it seems you got a blinded mind
I try to find the right girl in the right time
I need to breath and proceed to read the right signs
Where's the guidelines? I need some sort of help for now
I speak to anyone who thinks that they can help me out
I've held it out in front, I'm feeling kind of guilty though
That if I didn't change my ways it woulda killed me slowly
My shields up 'cause real love conceals me
And when she knows the real me whether she'll really feel me

[Chorus: 360 & Countbounce]
All these words might be hard for you to see
It's honesty, what I really need for me
It's all real what I need in her to be
And this song in itself sums up exactly what I need

[Verse 2: 360]
It took me years to reach the level where I'm at
That confused way of thinking, yo, I'll never get it back
And you've got years to grow, I know it takes time
But I can't be your boyfriend and your teacher at the same time
'Cause I need you on the same level I'm at
'Cause where I'm at now my brain's at a climax
And why's that? 'Cause I learnt to love my own company
And underneath my blood I've got a lot of love for me
Your physical's good if were bumpin' for the night
But what turns me on is if you're doing something with your life
'Cause I'm gonna wanna chick who's ambitious
Passionate too and who sticks to plans, listens
And got her shit together and she's hardly in need
Open honesty, always wears her heart on her sleeve
And that's it, when you find yourself you'll find me
But this song in itself sums up exactly what I need

[Chorus: 360 & Countbounce]
All these words might be hard for you to see
It's honesty, what I really need for me
It's all real what I need in her to be
And this song in itself sums up exactly what I need

[Verse 3: 360]
I know it ain't easy to say ya need me
Believe me, I'm gonna be pushed away if you needy
Need and want, they're two separate identities
But now you're in a state where you'll go and try anythin'
To be around me, can't be alone by yourself
Don't rely on me though, because I won't be your help
That's not harsh, I'm actually helping you in the long run
But once you found your feet you'll go and get that job done
But that don't mean that I'll never be around
'Cause I'm here whenever I can, whenever you be down
But if I'm the only thing that can pick you up
I can't have that pressure whenever all of this shit gets tough
You gotta sort all your own shit out first
Work it out yourself when you're feelin' like an outburst
This song's here and it's out to help
But know you'll find me once you've found yourself
It shows

[Chorus (Extended): 360 & Countbounce]
All these words might be hard for you to see
It's honesty, what I really need for me
It's all real what I need in her to be
And this song in itself sums up exactly what I need
All these words might be hard for you to see
It's honesty, what I really need for me
It's all real what I need in her to be
And this song in itself sums up exactly what I need

This is it
This is just too good to—to leave ya
I’m not going home [?]
You know I'm something to find
Because I'm one of a kind
3—3—3—360
The Alfred Hitchcock
The Alfred Hitchcock of Melbourne hip-hop
360
One of a kind

[Verse: 360]
Hey, yo, it’s me, myself, I, yeah, it’s '60 now
It mighta seemed like a dream since I’ve been around
I’ve been and found my feet, killin’ nouns and beats
I’m still a clown, don’t worry yo, I’m still around
I’ll only call Melbourne home when this album’s known
And I’m rockin’ sell-out shows down at Telstra Dome
I’ve felt I’ve grown, clear of all the yes man
It’s weird, my favourite MC's also my best friend
What up, PEZ? Man, I’m grateful you help me
That guidance that you gave me will be making us wealthy
This album’s fine and proud, straight from the underground
It’s got some uplifin’ shit for anyone who’s comin’ down
It’s my flow, mixed with lyrics that I write yo
People say their albums, but to me it’s like my bio
And from the crack of dawn it’s the same kid in the rap performance
Who ain’t afraid to rock a catchy chorus
And what I’m giving you, experience I’m livin’ through
Inspired by my own life and shit I listen to
And this is life, I’ll be rhymin’ 'til I’m 65
I make golden era hip-hop with a 60 vibe
I know you’re excited, but try and breathe and settle
Check all these tracks and get to know me on a deeper level
And stay positive, maybe [?] comedy
Whether deep reached or straight in your face honesty

[Outro: 360]
What you're seein’ is what ya get now
I stand my ground and I won’t be left out (Yeah, I’m pretty excited)
I still believe in myself to get proud (Yeah, yeah)
I’ll never let myself fall or step down (360)
What you're seein’ is what ya get now (Uh)
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
I still believe in myself to get proud
I’ll never let myself fall or step down

[Verse 1: Seth Sentry]
Yo
At all times now I hear the darkness calling
Yeah it's closer than it was and I just can't ignore it
So this is paranoia
Where every finger's pointed
Where everything looks haunted
Yeah so this is madness for ya
Is crazy something a man is born with?
Or just some marijuana or the acid talkin'
Or the alcoholic in me, shit I wish I had the answers for 'em
But all I know is that it has it's claws in, and I just can't avoid it
Now every shadow is a tar pit boiling over, it's so close I feel my back is cornered
And if I had a small wish, I wish I hadda fought it
But now it's too late, cause everything's too damn distorted
Yeah, man I wish I knew what started all this
I need some help and sure I can't afford it
Nah fuck your help I need a lighter now to spark the joint, because I'm fading away to the same place that Drapht was falling
Seth is gone, death is storm, this the calm before it
I'm just trying to summon the courage to bite the bullet
(Do it)
The walls are talking, I swear to god this apartment's haunted
Could all this be paranormal?
(Nah this is madness for you)
And so it goes without saying this is my last recording
Cause if you're hearing this now it means I must have done it
First off I really need to tell you just how much I'm sorry
I know that the news of my death was gruesome and hard to stomach
I'm sorry too for those who end up in the bathroom scrubbing up the mess
I guess I was clumsy, this shit was far too bloody
Plus the blade it was blunt and it couldn't cut me properly
I was in such a hurry it's close and I can't outrun it

Goodbye

[Verse 2: 360]
Uh
Ever since a kid I felt this way
The black sheep, I can never rid myself of hate
And some will say it's a mental disease
Well I just pray that I can make it to the end of the week
It's like I'll only find happiness when dead or asleep
They say in time it'll get better for me, but it forever repeats
It's like I'm on the search to find my inner peace
And the fact I know it's never there is killing me
Cause I'll be honest I'm trying to make it work
It's all I can think about but it's likely to make it worse and it hurts
Am I positive, no, I just wanted to go
It's like I'm trapped in my mind and I'm not letting go
They try to help me but I won't let 'em touch me
Until you've been in my shoes don't ever judge me
The only thing that ever seems to excite me is the thought of me leaving this life
It's the demon inside me, it screams to release and it needs to be leaving
I make myself bleed just to see him
Don't be scared it doesn't hurt while I bleed
I live in hell, if you go and search you'll find me
I don't think this world and this earth's what I need
And I don't think this place is for a person like me
Is that really such a bad thing?
And people always point fingers but really don't understand him
I need to chill I wanna leave here, serious, I'm being real I don't wanna be here
Period
Hey yo fuck it my life's hell I hate it
99% of my life's dealt with anger
See I just wanna get a shotty, go and end it properly
Doing everybody and myself a favour
And they say that your life's what you make it
I didn't ask for my own life, but I'll take it

It's the nice dude who's easy to speak to
To know what life's about without seein' a preview
And easily see-through the dudes who ain't real
Choose my fate even if losin' a late meal and
I like my songs to have feelings
And whether speakin' out crap or letting out what's concealed in
All these dudes love trains, every ride is planned
But I'm different, me? I'd rather ride a tram
With my headphones on, I'm daydreamin'
To pave the way, take it to slate 'cause it ain't even
I stay breathin', awake to the inner city
Walk a different path to plan like I was sippin' whiskey
Go to Vanilla Bay to say “hey”
Down paninis when I'm takin' the paper the same day
I'm a loud mouth, I fiend for the loud crowd
Rock a show hard then lounge down at the town house
And when it's time to wake, I bounce out

[Verse 2]
And when I left the scene, it felt like some fresh air
To not walk around a bunch of nutters giving death stares
Is this kid really serious? Yeah, maybe
What? You don't think he is because his hair's crazy?
He loves to run around, representin' Forthwrite
'Cause he knows they're bringin' the noise like an exhaust pipe
Only money made is Centrelink on fortnights
Battered with bad vision, the opposite of hawks' eyes
But then he saw his mask, it left him torn apart
Born to ask questions about this [shit] we callin' art
It's sort of hard, we're out livin' a confused life
He'll talk his heart then they're givin' him a bruised eye
If you're the type to see or believe sin
The only way to talk, you need to be preachin'
Don't follow when you don't believe what they're teachin'

[Chorus: Skylar Grey (Sampled)]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 1: Justice]
Yeah
This is more than music, it's a way of life
You can call it stupid, you can hate it, right?
This is not some torture, this is self-inflection
It's what happens when you scream and no one else is listening
This is ugly, this is tasteless, this is imperfection
It's adultery, this is hatred, this is indiscretion
This ain't David Blaine, this isn't misdirection
The music is the drug, the lyrics are the intervention
This is placebo effect, man, this is Panadol
It's free falling, no, shoot down that rabbit hole
It's the equivalent of TEC's guns, lock and load
It's the epitome of sex, drugs, rock and roll
It's your deepest fear, unbearable to think of
It's what I see when I'm staring at a ink blot
This is my brain, my eyes, this is my spinal chord
This is my state of mind, this is my life support
This is the truth underneath all the lies, but they know
That they fall deeper and deeper the higher they go
And even though you're on the edge an' you're tryna say no
You end up right back here, so might as well just let go

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah, with this I can reach a higher state
But without it, I'm fucked up and wide awake
I can't handle thinking anyone's above it
Can't even live until everybody loves it
And now I've gone and found the rules that I live and die with
Found myself tryna fight those who criticise it
Try to prove what it meant when they'd simplify it
To realise that I'm the one I'm in the fight with
Because I don't need this
But if I'm happy with myself, then they won't mean shit
I drop names so I might see some repercussions
I'm being honest though, so if they get offended; fuck 'em
I'm not a fighter; I'm a lover, mate
But if you are standing in my way then I'ma bite you in ya fucking face
Wait, 'cause that ain't even a threat at all
I'm just never stopping in this shit that I was destined for

[Chorus (Extended): Skylar Grey (Sampled)]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
Never said
I can't back the words I never said

[Verse 3: GMC]
A gift can be curse, a talent can be a burden
Could mine be one of those talents that's never hearda'?
Just another echo in a hallway full of has-beens?
Just another rapper who will always be the last in
Line? You get my piece hungry, like my last meal
But forget my priest, look
I ain't dying, I'm fighting to live
The only real fight that I gotta win is the fight in my head
And such is life, Cay-sa-ra-sa-rah mafucker
I'm on my grind mafucker, and such is life
For us generation F.L.Y
So stay tuned, the revolution gon' be televised
In the comfort of ya living room, watching us falling
Fly and find out what a mafucking milli' do
Yeah, so we'll see you when we touch down
Matter fact, fuck that, we ain't gonna come down

Let's headbutt clouds, I got a feeling you ain't falling down
Now I've reached a certain understanding what it's all about
Of such a small amount, life is what we talk about
You could be the shortest out, feel like you the tallest now
Go ahead and use me 'cause I'ma use you
And don't worry, I won't judge you if you use too
And you should probably use one, but I'ma use two
Don't be shocked about it, this is somethin' that I'm used to
Just love life with me, 'cause love's fine with me
Just unwind, come fly one time with me
I can feel it now, I'm way above takin' off
The negative, just shake it off, starin' in the face of God
I like to play a lot, play a lot
Maybe you can be the one to make me stop but, then again, maybe not
But, see, I'm knowing I should set you free
Now, my mind'll never let you leave, I think I'm crossing over

Yeah
Late night (late night), another black hole suck us in
We wondering where we are, wonder when the tunnel ends
It doesn't seem close, but I'm feeling good
And I hear that devil in my head, telling me I should
What's the innocent, never missed a step
But, tonight, the steps get harder since we've met
I was getting tired, you were wired, what a bad mix
But it's thriving on a thrill too, so inviting, need to have it
On a tail, I bite, like I ain't have any say
And let the cycle motion on and grab us away
Slow motion like I'm floating when the gravity fades
The lights flashing like I'm out on a stage
I know it's bad, but I doubt I can change
Though I try, but failure doesn't seem to counter the pain
So it helps, though I know it won't last forever
Still, the next day, I'm at it again, I think I'm crossing over

It's way too hot outside
And you can't trust anyone
You've had a long, hard ride
And the day's hardly begun
You've got nothing to lose
They took it all while you looked away
I know you've paid your dues
Do you need somewhere to stay?

[Chorus: Martian]
I'm a king
Yeah, said I'm a king
Whoo, said I'm a mo'fucking king
And we ain't worried 'bout a thing

[Verse 1: Martian]
Yeah, uh
They see me gaining speed, they treating me like royalty
I'm 'bout to build a dream where all these fans be spoiling me
I'm 'bout to build a team so go and pledge your loyalty
Now that my green is mean these fiends be tryna foil me
I came here with plenty of promise and emptied them pockets
Somewhere between earning plenty of profit and being a prophet
If you and your crew get to talking that shit I suggest that you stop it
They told me to go for gold, but I prefer platinum to be honest (Man, I'm feeling obnoxious)
Tell me where the crown at? Now, where the best girl in your town at?
Got my red robes in a backpack, star wise I got king down pat
I'm ready, on my work, yo, I keep it steady, on the bass, yo, I keep it heavy
On the crowd, yo, I keep 'em ready, I'ma work till I keep it sweaty
Lights up and it's showtime, getting head so deep that I blow minds
I flow fine with dope lines so don't try to cosign, I'ma showboat mine
I'm so fly make waves like a boat drive, so ask your girl who she been texting
See your next chick is my ex-bitch, yeah, I wreck shit, homie, you guessed it

[Chorus: Martian]
I'm a king
Yeah, said I'm a king
Said I'm a mo'fucking king
And we ain't worried 'bout a thing
(Ayy '60)

[Verse 2: 360]
Trust me yo, they don't want it, most of 'em going through
The motions with their flows, yo, they robotic, bro, stop it
Nobody can say that they the realest when I'm so honest
Me, myself, and I, fuck me off and you'll know both of us
Trust me yo, we won't stop it, making sure our own job is
Balling 'round the world like the Globetrotters
Every day we thrown offers, chilling in that throne office
Reaping what the throne offers so never taking the throne off us (Nup)
Ain't talkin' my massive dick, but yo, I'm so cocky
State of mind is always on that bogan shit, 'No worries'
Yeah, I made my own lane then I drove on it
Everybody wanna set a trend, we the motherfuckers that have both done it
Sound now's going down south, everybody wanna go or go on it
My gal now's got a foul mouth, she get more beeps than the Roadrunner
(Like damn) I can't preach 'cause I'm no prophet
They say time is money, or money is time
Either way I make the most of it

[Chorus: Martian & 360]
I'm a king
Yeah, said I'm a king
Said I'm a mo'fucking king
And we ain't worried 'bout a thing

[Outro: Martian & 360]
Yeah
Mini Coop, 360
Level up, haha

Sick of wings in hospitals, dude

Why's that? 'Cause I haven't slept all summer long
To me this is sorta like a summer song
And we killed that shit so run along
Packing a MAC in the back of an actual Ac'
Like Big Pun, but I'm actually fatter than that
I got what you happen to lack
And I ain't married to rap, homie, that'd be faggoty as

[Verse 1:]
I'll challenge your team to a brawl, motherfucker, I won't mean it at all
So, if this shit hits the fan, I ain't cleaning the walls, no
I'm with a grumpy whore, looking for some drugs to score
We need to pull it together, tug of war
When I was born I wasn't fucking around
Doctor pulled me out the womb, I punched the cunt in the mouth
(Oi, you touchin' my mum?) Check out my bone structure
Look, Styalz man, I'm so fucking good, even my own mother would

[Verse 2:]
Yo
Yo I'm a motherfucking thug homie, hell yeah, I like to rob a lot
I ain't no b-boy but you'll see me poppin' locks
I'm a break into your bottle shop, smash all your dodgy Scotch
And start lining up some Vodka shots
Everything is looking up right now
Maybe that's because I'm hanging upside down
If I get famous I'm a brown eye the Paparazzi
After I tat my arse cheeks just to camouflage me
(Whose arse is that?!)

We drinking Mai-tai's, then we say goodnight, bye

[Verse 1: Seth Sentry]
When I was five, I wanted to fly a starship
Now I'm twenty-five and I can't even drive a car, shit
Ask girls to come back to my apartment
Try to dink 'em on my push bike and I get laughed at
So these days, when I'm askin' out dates
I pick 'em up around eight in the car with L plates
And my mum up in the front seat half an hour late
But nothing much changed, they still laugh in our face
So I'm carvin' out a name
As a rapper 'cause I'll never get a girl without the fame
And plus I'm bored with watching porn and gettin' rope burn
I need a fortune to afford myself a chauffeur
But luckily my flows works and it's so perfect
Even if I rap with no words, it's still a dope verse
Did my homework and pressed myself an EP
Sold three copies, now I'll probably be on TV
Bought myself a big wallet for the profits that I get from it
Then I saw my shit up on a bit torrent
Got pissed off, at least I got some big props
From this kid Koptic when he said my voice was hypnotic
So get on it, go and buy yourself six copies
From the MySpace or download it if you're dishonest
But it's nice if you bought the album, legit
Shit, I could use all the help I can get
I'm so sick of gettin' bouncers at my own sets
Who won't let me in unless I tell 'em that I know PEZ
But that's my own mess that nobody knows Seth
I should probably do shows more and get stoned less
And it's a battle on the road, less traveled
'Cause most heads I know just rappers if they're tone deaf
And that's cool, I got a sing song flow I guess
And you can hear it on the EP that you should go and get
I had a guy that asked me for my autograph
Nah, not really, but that'd be awesome, huh?
So when I say ""Seth""
You say ""who the fuck is that?""
And guess what? Seth's not famous man
Most people know me from my Xbox gamer tag
Yeah, I heard he had a face like a one tonner
Why you think I put artwork on the front cover?
So if you got a friend that loves rhymin'
I got a present, but with better darn prices
Even if you're in a credit card crisis
Buy the shit and I can get my car licence

[Verse 2: 360]
I don't even get scared in cemeteries
You get scared when you don't know where your teddy bear is
I'm where it started, I'm everything that matters
If the Devil wears Prada then the Devil is a faggot, uh
I’m gettin' in it the minute I start rappin'
I'll hit 'em with sarcasm and kick 'em and laugh at 'em
If you know some sick women, introduce me
Girls love Matt Groening like Simpsons groupies
But I don't like having sexual intercourse
I just like knowin' that my genitals fit in yours
I'll send a message to Biggie Smalls
I can't find my style yet, yeah, you get it? Then gimme yours
I'll win awards for my next release
But won't thank no one in my acceptance speech
And PEZ and me haven't sleep for weeks, Seth can see
But he'll never know if it's meth or speed
To calm me down, you better get some weed (weed)
So I can see time fly through my mind's eye
And if you're talking about the highlights, you're talking about my rhymes
Talk about the high life, talk about my life
At night time, I might just ride by
Saying ""take your fuckin' watch off your wrist because it’s my time""
I'm already high on life
But I get high on ice just to get twice as high
When we're stepping on stage while you're reppin' your train lines
With fans that take time to get their Mexican wave right
I’ll have my Conchord with a built in squash court
And still be complainin' that I want more
And we about to go on tour with Tom York
I know you've heard of us, wait – what’s that song called?
And while you’re standin' in a circle kickin' frees
We're drivin' 'round a park in a perfect limousine

[Verse 3: PEZ]
Uh, yeah, you might have heard of Six and me
Yo, it's Forthwrite bitch, the only surfers in the scene
Rockin' tight top shirts and fitted jeans
Listen close to this, it's the only verse you'll get for free
Off one song man I'm earning fifty Gs
While you want a punch on because you're turnin' fifty-three
Fuck the urban city dream
Give me a house in a suburban little street, I prefer to live in peace
I’m killin' shit if you don't know by now
You better turn this off and go find out
I'm not jokin' homie, turn this off and go right now
It's showtime, blow! I'm building up a buzz
So motherfuckin' big that it won't die down
I'm the future, yes I'm in O-nine now and we the captains
See the weaker rappers keep adaptin'
It's easy you can speak to me or Three and see what happens
I can't see the reason half you dudes are even rappin'
You're fuckin' terrible, I'm incomparable to most
'Cause the flow's impeccable it's so
Incredible now everybody knows
I hear raw cliques talk shit about ""The Festival Song""
When they can't even comprehend the fuckin' level I'm on
They can't really even seem to ever pen a good song
Go and listen to the rest of my songs
And come back and we can talk, man I'm leadin' forward
You're just doing things I've already seen before
So I'm not listenin' to it or skippin' on through it
I'm sick of gettin' shit and thinkin' this isn't music
I hear these dudes still preachin' that keep it real shit
Yeah that's what you dudes do, you keep it real shit
I begun, no wonder you people fear shit
Fuckin' hell, I can't even finish that shit

[Verse 4: 360]
Fuck those cunts man, let 'em be, they're worthless
A bunch of centipedes who would never reach the surface
I'm sendin' dead MCs and enemies in hearses
And dead in beef and every week and never leave the churches
And say that 360's centimetre perfect
But even when I'm off by a centimetre, perfect
And my initials are my destiny, get the letters M and C
Get it, get it's meant to be I'm perfect
Acclaim asked if I fuck heaps of fats
The fact is I lost count, fuck keepin' track
Man, you're probably thinkin' what the fuck beat is that?
But make you forget the beat thinkin' fuck he can rap
Uh, remember the days of basketballin'?
Man, I only rap for kicks 'cause I can't afford 'em
And my sights are as high up as Michael Jordan
Only job I’ll have in my life’s performin'
See you talkin', see you in the afterlife son
You biting many styles 'cause it's hard to find one
But we have that after night fun with these hot tarts
We ain't rockstars but we party like some
Yeah, it seems these days, the topic's swagger
Cool now but don't rule out the subject matter
Stop rappin' I ain't wantin' to hear ya
'Cause people love Sixty's music and ain't talkin' a era, no
We hit up rap with heaps of decent dimes
Who like to lick their fingers just to read between the lines
Rubbing their gums while we're runnin' amok with more
Junk in the trunk than a truck full of drugs to haul
This is do or die, it's either suicide or crucify
You decide, either way, you lose your life
There's a 360 crew but they're spelled different
My name has no letters in the alphabet
I can smell success and man it smells like sex
And so smell it

[Verse 5: PEZ]
You know we're comin' live from Triple R
Takin' Aussie rap music on a different path
The kid who spits the sickest bars like it isn't hard
On that breakthrough debut, sittin' in the charts
Another month, I'll be a bigger star than Jimmy Barnes
It's pretty simple, you don't like it, you can kiss my arse
I'm out having rich dinners 'cause I'm livin' large
You're at home drinkin' Vic Bitter, tryna fix ya car
It's a laugh mate you try to call that hip-hop?
Shit, as soon as I turn it on, I just switch off
Even if I just burn it, it's like I'm ripped off
People probably heard it, that's why your shit flopped

[Verse 6: Seth Sentry]
I'm pretty certain I'm the laziest person I know
I sit at home in the day with the curtains all closed
Just burnin' a roach, watchin' Murder She Wrote
'Cause I lost the remote and just search for it
So hard I'd rather sit and work for the show
Until it's over then it's Oprah? I prefer a good soap
Shit, I watch commercials and I purchase my phone
And then return it after thirty days, dirty and broke
I gotta leave these burgers alone
'Cause I've almost outgrown the only shirt that I own
Plus, I'm pretty sure that someone burgled my home
(No) I swear I had a girlfriend and some furniture though?
I'm broke dope rapper murder a flow
But it's so much work to go rehearse for a show
Shit, I used to do gigs and freestyle for two minutes
Lose interest and be home in bed before the tune finished
Illusionist at work, I had it good
Just stand in one spot at a job and try to look stressed
Yep, and that's the key to success
Success sucks PEZ, I couldn't give a fuck less
I'm feelin' the ceilin', I'm killin' these tracks
I just write the punchlines and PEZ fills in the gaps
Perhaps it's a fact that if I napped less
I'd have more time to practice and get my raps fresh

All right, yo, uh

I ain't invisible, I'm giving you the real me
So put your hand out, I want you to feel me
Really, listen while I'm gettin' on that honesty tip
Yo, pretend there's no beat and let me talk for a bit
If being honest and only going off skill alone
Fuck it, we better hurry up and build a throne
Promoters booking us for gigs, but we billed below
You see we ain't the main acts, but we steal the show
I feel we're the best and yeah, I know this country want it
I know we joke a bit but I'm being fucking honest
And with my friends lately I'm a little bit distant
The music that I'm making is a little bit different
I locked myself away to make a masterpiece
Open up my heart and I'm giving you a part of me
Now the singles, I hope we picked the right one
Try and run with the best to represent what I have done
And understand it's so important that the radio plays it
It can make it or break it, what I'm basically sayin' is
That I ain't tryna cater to a market
I'm tryna be creative as an artist
And if you don't feel what I felt it's all good, homie
'Cause I keep it real yo, real to myself
Yo, this is what I wanna do yo, listen dog
This is me, why would I write it for you, huh?
Don't get me wrong though, I ain't hatin' boom bab
Yes, I am a fan of that, but I ain't gonna do that
I knew when I was making this I would cop flack
But I stand behind what I'll do so I'll cop that
And friends sayin' I should diss dudes on track
But see I'm twenty-four now, I'm beyond that
But see, I gotta leave my ego at the door
So from now on I ain't gonna see 'em anymore

[Verse 1: 360]
Hi, could you spare some change?
I've been living at these stairs for days
Days like this I can barely take it
'Cause people don't really seem to care today, shit
And they're afraid 'cause I talk to myself
I wish I didn't have to, I talk 'cause it helps
Any time that it's silent and my mind's still
I hear the screams from the people that I've killed

[Chorus 1: Lisa Mitchell]
Do you, do you
Do you have a dollar? Do you have a dollar for me?
Have you got a house on a hill and a bed for three?
Oh, do you have a story? Do you have a story for me?
Do you know the one where we all live happily?

[Verse 2: 360]
Tell me, what's it like for you to judge me?
You cross the road, does it frighten you to touch me?
It's funny that you can go from fighting for you country
To getting locked away for fighting 'cause you're hungry
When I get money I get high 'cause I'm a junkie
I never used to do it, but I like it 'cause it numbs me
I've barely made four dollars
But I'd appreicate your help because I wanna escape

[Chorus 2: Lisa Mitchell]
Do you, do you
Do you have a dollar? Do you have a dollar for me?
Maybe just an hour or two and a pot of tea
Have you got a memory? Have you got a memory for me?
Tell me 'bout the days when you were seventeen

[Verse 3: 360]
Ayo, I take a lot of shit 'cause I need to
It helps me to forget it all, so gimme the needle
And honestly I've killed a lot of innocent people
Sent by a country where that shit is illegal
And if you kill in your country it's no way
But if you do it for you country it's suddenly okay
I would end it, but I never follow it through
So maybe spare some money, just a dollar will do
Thank you

[Chorus 2 (Extended): Lisa Mitchell]
Do you, do you
Do you have a dollar? Do you have a dollar for me?

Yo, yeah
Equality's what's needed, when that honesty stays
I have a feeling we'll be livin' in this wondrous place
In my view we need to make the poverty change
Not just hide it like we did during the Commonwealth Games
Yeah, they got the money, they should give 'em a bed
But you know they'd rather dinners instead
With their infinite endless supply of easy living with cheques
And decorated for our visitors friends to leave 'em impressed
Why the fuck are they deleting the trees?
It ain't a known fact that everybody needs them to breathe?
I gotta say now, why wasn't David Hicks back?
Needed to be at home so he could face this riffraff
Uh, save the chitchat excuses you've made
There's never an excuse for the youth you could save
(Never, never) I know the remedy for soothing your pain
You just use a mute view of this beautiful place, it's like that

Sometimes I do think this way
Maybe one day you'll all feel the same
(This way) I'm hoping I can pave the way
Where you're lookin' at an infinite day, come on and tell 'em more
Sometimes I do think this way
Maybe one day you'll all feel the same
(This way) I'm hoping I can pave the way

Now hear me out, I shouldn't need to repeat
We can all afford words with the freedom of speech
And me, I chase goals, I believe in a dream
And most of all I believe in belief
So I speak to the teens and let 'em know there's hope if you want it
Fight for what you wanted and be openly honestly
And gain profits, I'll be screaming out love to the people
'Cause I'm living in a place where the guns are illegal
(Shot down) I feel cops need to stop the real crimes
Instead of enforcing petty little laws just to kill time (True)
I feel fine 'cause I'm living in the most liveable place
I find it's like an infinite taste
Of what's to come, uh, any day you're under the sun
And any second, yo, the thunder will come
Then I run in to find you all the remedy for soothing your pain
You just use a mute view of this beautiful place, it's like that

[Chorus]
Sometimes I do think this way
Maybe one day you'll all feel the same

My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm daydreaming every day
My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer

[Verse 2: Azmarino]
And I'm a dream, I'm a dream, I'm a dreamer
You say it's not possible, I don't believe ya
I live my life, live my life to the fullest
I walk around all peaceful like a Buddhist
So check me out if your mind is a mess now
You're always trying to hide that you're stressed out
Man, you need to chill out
Take a deep breath, think what it's really 'bout
Uh, remember when I was a child
I was so wild, couldn't keep me in the house
I'd be out all day, playing in the park
My mom call my name every time it gets dark
'Cause I come from a place where you only get nightmares
People shout it down so you never put it out there
Keep it to yourself and that's where it's best kept
And this is the recipe behind my success, so

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
I'm daydreaming every day
My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm daydreaming every day
My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer

[Post-Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
I'm a dream, I'm a dreamer
I'm a dream, I'm a dreamer
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer

[Verse 3: 360]
I'm sitting in a room and I'm daydreaming
How all this success is a strange feeling
And will it all last, or will it all pass?
And all this random shit that my brain deals with
Yeah, I got my head in the clouds
Random raps, got the phone out to get it all down
Thinkin' 'bout the next show and expecting a crowd
Too excited, got a Valium to settle me down
Spent years home at mom and dad's messing around
But now my favourite part of it is my parents are proud
Never listen to the hater if he getting me down
And no words are ever stopping me progressing my sound, no
Stay positive, I do prefer this
Looking forward to the things that I can do with my kids
And I'm thinking 'bout flying to the moon to work this
'Cause the sky ain't the limit, yo, the universe is, and

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
I'm daydreaming every day
My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm daydreaming every day
My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer

[Post-Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah, listen, before music was a piece of my life
I used to play basketball, that was me every night
I wanted to play college to, yo I'd reach for the sky
Until, at eighteen, I caught some disease in my eye, yeah
I had to stop playing, what should I do?
When ball was the only thing I wanted to do
Listen, that forced me to focus on music
Pez sat me down like ""bro we can do this""
After hearing that I didn't need more really
Going half blind made me see more clearly
Yo, I've learnt to take the good with the bad
I'm half blind yeah but now have a look where I'm at
When something seems to turn negative in life
You can always go and turn it into anything you like
So if it happens just remember every time
Yo, a tragedy can always be a blessing in disguise

[Hook: Gossling]
When you're on your own
No one's there for you
When you're all the way home
There'll be a miracle in a costume

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah, uh
When I was young I was attracted to the dark side
I wanted everyone to see me as the hard guy
Walking around with my mates trying to start fights
Hoping they wouldn't want to cause I can't fight
Thinking back now that shit could of ended crazy
I'm just glad that situation never faced me
Back then I was thinking you could never change me
What a dickhead, that's not how my parents raised me
See I wasn't facing the facts
Acting crazy, wishing I could take it all back but
It took one of my mates to get stabbed just to realize
This shit wasn't a game, it was wack
That's how I wrote ""So Fake"" so easily
'Cause, apart of those dudes, I could see in me
So, if somebody is wanting to fight
Just swallow your pride and leave it be and that's real

[Hook: Gossling]
When you're on your own
No one's there for you
When you're all the way home
There'll be a miracle in a costume

[Verse 3: 360]
Yeah, yeah, uh, I nearly died in an accident
Yeah, and so I wrote this story
It's funny though how the worst thing to happen
Probably was the best thing for me
Falling and Flying shouldn't take this long
But thanks to the crash, yo I made this song
So now I ain't afraid to see the day that I die
Because, with this, I'll be staying alive (I'll be staying alive)
Yeah, I believe in believing the sky's the limit
Have a look and you'll see me up there, flying in it
It's a nice view, sometimes you might lose
But understand when you fall you can fly too
Don't let anybody tell you what you can't do
Don't let them enter in your head because they aren't you
And understand you could have anything you want
If you put the effort in to remember what you've got

[Hook: Gossling]
When you're on your own
No one's there for you
When you're all the way home
There'll be a miracle in a costume

You get burned if you talk mate‚ I'm servin' you born fakes
The serial killer like I was murderin' Cornflakes
You bitch faggots don't believe this shit
I'll leave you seethin' and even stop you from breathin' bitch
I need to spit‚ see me defeating your scripts
Such a nutter‚ I'm leavin' with the evilest kids
And you're feeble as piss, if you people are dissin'
I'll have you curled up in the corner in the foetal position
A foul child with the like of my skill
I stole Martyr Ryan's ID for my license to kill
You get your lungs crushed by my nunchucks
And I ain't of Jewish faith so you know that I'm uncut
Me and the boys got our own fight club
We hardcore like dartboards in [?] pubs

I prank called the government with fake terrorist threats
I've got a fan base all over the landscape
I'm not your friends, I don't step to me with a handshake
You're needin' band-aids from my rampage
I'll melt your body and I'll cook your skin for a pancake
Writing in the dark 'cause I'm raw‚ see

Hot diggity (yo, people don't even realise)
Forthwrite, homeboys
I'm wearin' an ankle sock on my balls
[?] nice, so that way it sort of just, just cups under [?]

[Verse 1: 360]
Ayo, Sixty's in the building, and I spit some shit you feel
[?] leavin' peeps in perfect health in a critical condition
It's the limited edition, I write my rhymes
In the projects and change my name to Lyrical Commission
Ha! You all get it, you know when Sixty hits the rhythm
'Cause all the clothes that I rock I bought from This Is It in Richmond
I sit and listen, when I flip the sickest spittin'
Like Weapon X and Ken Hell, I live for kicks and women
A binger with the bitters, drinkin' gin and flippers
Writin' lyrics with a system with a Liquor Switch in mixtures
With rims witnessing, my spit is blinging wicked, yo
I shift 'em in from England, they're the prince's rings but twisted
And when it comes to chattin' chickies, shit is wicked
God, I need some moisturiser 'cause my fist and lips are blistered
I'm sick of zinging, so I spit some shit, concealing
How I'm gifted with the lyrics, throwing dicks up in your missus
Bitches

[Interlude: 360]
""Hey, 360, that was a fuckin' good rap rhyme, I fuckin' liked that one. If people don't like it then I'll fuckin' smash their skull in with fuckin' Dove moisturising cream for being soft cocks and swimmin' in dandelions underneath the fuckin' rainbows, the fuckin' cunts. Where's that PEZ cunt?""

[Verse 2: PEZ]
Uh emphatic
Ayo, now it's PEZ, I'm at it, I'm fixin' to get emphatic
And spittin' my shit as if all my listeners didn't matter
I'm sittin', I'm kickin' back and I sip on a drink and stagger
A binger, a liquor addict, no, really I kicked the habit
But shit can happen, so listen, I get it crackin'
My writtens are really whack but I hit on a spliff and rap
I've been given it if you clap a legit and it isn't actin'
I'm thinkin' this bitch is sick 'cause my shit's from a different planet
Yo, I'll give the facts, I'm a hippie with different passions
I'm livin' off shitty rations, my fifty odd chickens hatched 'em
Or fish and chips, they're all twisted up in their package
The chips, I can get in quick but not fish if it isn't battered
Uh, ditch the wheelchair, bitches all think I'm braggin'
I'm blingin' with rims, switched 'em and fitted 'em to my wagon
I'm hittin' on chicks at random and gettin' 'em into tandems
If sixty women give in, I will flip and I'll get a tantrum

[Outro: 360]
Yeah
We're the best rappers in this country, bitch
Just don't know yet, it hasn't clicked (ha ha ha)
""Yeah, that was PEZ and '60 from Forthwrite, the band. And if you talk shit about them, then I'll snap one off on your fuckin' face and smudge it in ya faggot cunt! Don't be a fairy, eatin' teddy bear biscuits, go run to mummy in your fuckin' ankle socks and Dunlop bollies fuckhead!""

[Ad-Libs: 360]
Uh
Yo, yeah

[Verse 1: 360]
I'm being honest, yo, I think that I'm a good dude
But I have no idea lately what I should do
I just can't believe the test that I've been put
And I just got no choice but to be strong and push through
Had a simple plan, now this shit is different, damn
Unexpected negatives and everything has hit the fan
I wanna run, but I gotta be the bigger man
The shit that's going has me feeling like a little ant
And if you really understood then you would not blame me
And people seeing my success and see I'm complaining
I know my song's played every single day
But apart from all the music everything is going wrong lately
And if you don't know me well then you won't know
I've mastered the art of feeling that I don't show
And don't go and judge my life if you don't know
Half of it is high, but the other half is so low
And music's good, but unfortunately
I've seen a standup family get brought to their knees
Normally he'd [?] deal with it would talk to a beat
But lately that ain't an option and frankly that is a problem
You see I wanna write these words 'cause it helps
But I can never put it out 'cause it'll hurt someone else
Listen, so the pen is like my psychiatrist
And the music is the only set of wings that I am flying with
It's hard to describe exactly what I get from music
I'd be a fucking nervous wreck if I ever lose it
I've got problems and this shit is therapeutic
I start hitting rock bottom if I never use it
I love life, but honestly I'm stuck
See it's got me in a rut, I wanna run, but that's the worst way
And sometimes it makes you wanna turn to drugs
But the drugs are the reason that it's fucked in the first place

[Chorus (Sampled): Frank Ocean]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

[Verse 2: Prime]
They got us fighting for control over somebody no one's ever heard of
Swearing on a bible that we don't believe a word of
Too cool for a mentor, there's no one we can learn off
This show's getting too real, I vote that we should turn off
But every channel's the same, reality's changed
You can't tell who's putting on an act for the game
I can't tell if I'm actually sane 'cause people tell me
I'm different when everyone else is exactly the same
Or how even though I'm attracted to fame and people tell me
""Shoot for the stars,"" all I do is practice my aim
So you can say what you want, you can say I'm deceitful
I can say in a song what you can't say to some people
You been keeping up appearances, I was coming on slow
60 tell me ""Tryna get my game on pronto""
I was at the party, off my face on Cointreau
I was tryna party, get my rage on: Rondo
Career had a tag without a name on: John Doe
If they identified it as dead they were wrong though
It ain't a crime, I wanna live clean
Doing what I done best since I was sixteen
I got a small opportunity, a big dream
Tryna see both points of view like a split screen
My ears pinned back, ready for the future
Till I get my cape on and everything is super

[Chorus (Sampled): Frank Ocean]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

[Bridge (Sampled): Frank Ocean]
I'm goin' off (Oh, my pretty love)
Don't try stopping me
I'm goin' off (Throw me a line)
Don't try saving (Broke my heart)
No flares (Broke my heart)
No vest (Drove my love)
And no fear
Waves are washin' me out

[Chorus (Sampled): Frank Ocean]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

Oh no
Don't die, don't die, don't die
Oh no, oh no no
Don't die, don't die, don't die
Oh no
Don't die, don't die, don't die

[Verse 1]
Now I’m stealin’ beats from my favourite Canadian cat
So I could hit him with Australian raps, now I’m taking it back
To make payments with no paper or cash
Every word I spit is truth without stating the facts
My statement is that no one not once taking me back
If there’s hate in what you’re sayin’ then my name isn’t Matt
‘Cause I’m waitin’ very patient till my name’s in [?]
And there’s no excuse for hate, so go on take it on back
And yo, I’m thankful (For what?) Yo, I’m thankful for that
Thankful for every question that you bank on a [?]
Hopin’ that he might stumble, fallin’ flat on his back
And so polite, most the times no one’s thankin’ him back
It’s that socialite, a certain few are hopin’ he dies
But hoping is inaction so they know he’ll survive
He’s grown to his height, regardless, you still know that he’ll rise
And realise you’ll always see him if you open your eyes

[Chorus]
I feel this is what I see
Walkin’ on an empty road
Crooked footsteps underway
Never knowin' where to go
No realness, all a dream
Starin’ at my life below
Hope my life’ll form a trail
To get where I wanna go, I don’t understand

[Verse 2]
You have doubts believin’ you’ll be somethin’
But doubts are your enemy, lead you to see nothin’
You can’t help it, you’re eager to see somethin’
You’re seein’ your dream stuck and you’re needin’ the freedom to be
One with yourself and you’re runin’ through hell
Lived a life of others, never fell in love with himself
And that’s what’s needed to ever be completed and knowin’ what’s true
Always defeated ‘cause you never will focus on you
And yo, it’s good to be compassionate
But give yourself an itch or somethin’ or your spirit takes some damagin’
There’s no accidents, just fate and destiny too
So why have a million friends and one enemy – you
And I can tell you callin’ for help
You gotta try and work it out and maybe call on yourself
And put down the shield and maybe talk to yourself
That’s your main biggest problem, you’re at war with yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
In your life, there’s one to find
You gotta know it takes some time
But when you work it out you feel
Better than before
And in your life, there’s one to find
You gotta know it takes some time
But when you work it out you feel
Better than before

[Chorus]
I feel this is what I see
Walkin’ on an empty road
Crooked footsteps underway
Never knowin' where to go
No realness, all a dream
Starin’ at my life below
Hope my life’ll form a trail
To get where I wanna go, I don’t understand

Don't take me for granted
I ain't your fool
Ain't gonna take your shit no more
Said I'm leaving, won't be back home
I tried so many times
So many ways
Don't throw it all away by
Sayin' you love me
You didn't mean it
You just got my heart and left me cold (Uh)

[Verse: 360]
These scattered memories, a list of broken photographs
All the things I wanna know, if I could only ask
It seems always accustomed to have a broken heart
But honestly we both should start admitting that we've grown apart
And in the past years, I've only grown to hating love
'Cause all the beauty is ruled out by the pain in love
And don't get angry when I say that I'm afraid to love
Because you took too much advantage when I gave you trust
And now I try to see it normally and clear in my eyes
But now I can't 'cause of fears and the lies
I try to make it work, but know that really it's died
Every day I'm sitting praying I can feel it alive
For just a split second to taste the feeling of life
'Cause every time it gets remotely close, I feel it's a lie
I try letting down the shield in hope of healing my eyes
Now I'm barred of all emotion, now I'm merely alive
But why?

[Chorus: Oso]
Don't take me for granted
I ain't your fool
Ain't gonna take your shit no more
Said I'm leaving, won't be back home

So many ways

Sayin' you love me

Yeah, uh
Yeah, one drug, yeah

I see women as drugs, I'm wishin' all of them were givin' it up
'Cause when I’m down, that's what's picking me up

And people shrug it off like I'm livin' it up
Deep down, the whole time I've been wishin' for love
Wishin' I could meet a girl who would fit like a glove
Then we force a connection with this innocent lust
As soon as the sex is over then I'm finished, it's done
But am I a bad person? Am I a tad worse than
Anybody who's ever committed mass murders?
'Cause I'm killin' their entire trust in men
I feel like I’m evil 'cause they'll never feel that lust again
Because of me, and now I only trust my friends
But honestly, yo, I'm wishin' I could love again

Yeah, Illy Illy, uncle 6 Dog
Stand the fuck up, cunts
Yeah

[Verse 1: Illy]
And I hear motherfuckers dissing me, tryna bait me or battle me
Berate me to rattle me, it's pitiful
Already gave a few K to charity, so I ain't giving any leg ups
To any fuckheads calling me faggot switch up your strategy
Like ""Shoosh cunt"", it's hard to keep it passive every day
When you're incessantly attacked for every action that you take
Every statement, every track, though I brag you can't escape
The fact, my arrogance is purely my reaction to the hate
'Cause I would never step on people's toes
For real, I think it's honestly 'cause nobody expected me to blow up, but
In 30 months I've gone from practically unknown
To practically the biggest fucking name without a plaque to show
But some don't matter what I give it, I could wrap it up and gift it
They'd skip it and say whoever on the track with me ripped it
Same way they say my album missed and actually think
Someone who's only heard hit singles has a valid opinion, nah
I hate feeling like I need to justify this, like
Because I'm doing must be writing just so fuckers buy it
What a cop out, haters brush aside my sacrifices
Tall poppies in a sea of ply punching pirates
Came up in the scene, paved my route
From seventeen I been giggin', thought I paid my dues
Only took a few rave reviews, a Triple J play or two
For all the knives to aim at guess who, fuck am I to do?
I don't beg no one for help for shit that I can fix
And I don't blame nobody else for sitches that I find I'm in
Ain't never withheld admiration for the pioneers or kings
So why the fuck would I begin to, I just do my thing
All haters got for their venom is jealous talks
Fuck a twenty for their disc, ain't got a penny for their thoughts
When I'm questioned with hate my only answer is love
Forward slash Illyal, tell 'em Stand The Fuck Up, right

[Verse 2: 360]
Ayo, my plan is unstuck
And when they question who the best is, yo, the answer comes up
With 360, check the madness uncut
Yo, I said Please Be Seated but Stand The Fuck Up, yeah
I was smart to give a taste in what I'm gonna do
So sit and watch and see lotta dudes follow suit
I understand if it's not for you, true
But I wrote it for myself and it's exactly what I wanted to
I got a name from the battle scene, battle scene
I got featured in some magazines, magazines
Just another kid who had a dream, but see
I'm knowin' where I came from, I'ma never stop battling
Shut the fuck up haters
Yo, I can't battle someone nameless just to make another dumb cunt famous
I'm living in the twilight zone
Where we treatin' every battle like it's fight night though
And I'm winnin', I will never let the limelight go
But yo, I seen a lot of styles, gotta find my own
But conform to what you want, I'd rather slice my throat
And when it comes to business, I mind my own
See it's not quite underground, not quite pop
And it's not quite indie and it's not quite rock, no
I never listen, doin' [?]
And keepin' everybody happy, yo it's not my job, no
So you can have fans that like it
Then they turn their back on you the second that the masses find it
But not knowin' that you made a lotta sacrifices
But when the haters get you down, let 'em go, you don't have to fight it
Uh, I'm a believer in good music
If I like the beat, fuck the politics, I should use it
Yeah, them times were raw
But it's 2011 and these motherfuckers rappin' like it's '94
You can never go dispute my fuckin' passion for it
I enjoy making songs that have a catchy chorus
Never lackin' in my raps at all, plus
I am always energetic, never see me give a flat performance

That's power, bitch!

Aye, we know how to steal a show yo take it from the best homie
Follow my lead, you ain't taking it again from me
I am in the zone playing at my best, yo we push the game forwards
Why you staying on the fence homie
You ain't even hopping off at all
Got the jump in real life you barely make it to the net
Working background crew but you staying with the press
Only work the front that's why you staying on the bench
Yo the game's nearly finished, you ain't playing in it yet
The baller that you think you are is made up in your head
You made up millis when you were making a percent
You ain't paving a way homie you paving the cement
Put your money where your mouth is
I'm aiming for you head boy
The deal you got is barely paying for your rent boy
How you number one you ain't stadium yet
You just post it up on Facebook, creating an event boy
I call the shots, if I say it then it's in
Money off the glass then I'm banking it again
Take the money that you score and start bragging to your friends
Take the points off the board, you ain't having them again
Whole team took an L, you should take it for your friend
But instead of taking blame you just naming all of them
Start owning your mistakes instead of blaming on the rest
Taking charge like a man, stop blaming the offense
You ain't dropping out of anywhere, save it for the net
I didn't come here to be your friend, I came here to collect
In a matter of a day you get taken by the feds

But it's worse when I'm not 'cause it's much harder
There's no money to your name at all, you gotta save some more
But, every week, you still get paid or still take it all
But, how can you stop a killer who doesn't break the law
My control, you can fight it, but I'll make you poor
You're a masochist, no breaking jaws
You know it's going to hurt but still you go and take some more
But, any dignity you've got, I'm gonna take it all
But my spirit's only gonna end up breaking yours
I'm everywhere from the reflection of any wine glass
To the echos of emptiness in a guy's flask
Destruction perfected into a fine art
Justice would have me killed instead of sitting behind bars

MINI COOP: Dude, I'm on the fucking news. Holy shit
NEWS INTRO: New news. News. News. News.
NEWS ANCHOR: We're here with some breaking news. Mini Coop's upcoming album, Lift Off, has come under fire as skeptics say it's going to be quote, ""Literally the worst thing to happen to hip-hop."" We're now getting a call from Australian artist 360 to discuss the issue. 360, what are your thoughts?
MINI COOP (Collision): Woah, woah, woah. What?! The fuck?! Dude, 360. Come on
360: Yes, yeah, I know Mini Coop. [?] I mean, he's—he's—like he's cool—like, you know, he's cool. He's all musical and shit, and that's—that's, you know, he does his thing, but, I mean... what kind of fuckhead plays guitar? You know? Like... who plays piano? I mean—yeah, he raps, yeah. I mean rapping's cool, but, everything else is pretty, you know. What about, I even heard he plays the drums!
MINI COOP (Collision): Fuckin' right he does! He's gonna tell all these arseholes this is bullshit! What? Dude. Jesus Christ. Ah, man, fuck this.

[Intro: 360]
Word life yo, huh
I've fin' and done bin', Doin' that shit
Homies, word, Hahaha
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: 360]
Talk about most media, ""I hate it""
They should report the news and not create it
Everyday obsessing with anybody that's famous
And make up there own little stories and go and claim it
Australia needs for Damien Leith
To save all his money made and go and straighten his teeth
""I'll fight you for it""
And last week I went to lay on the beach
And saw this hottie getting burnt, so I gave her some cream
""There you go"" I went to dinner with this elegant chick
Made my mission to yell and tell her what arrogance is
Made her shout me a feed and embarrass the bitch
Dropped a fart and then screamed ""Your fucking manners are shit!""
""I beg your pardon!"" Yeah, you bet i farted
Buy me a drink, I'm planning to get retarded
Anyways I'm off, you better not get me started
But you better check the present I left in your parent's garden

[Hook: Joelistics & (360)]
Ain't trying to get ???
Anything that you tell me to do
You and me got something good
Don't worry about how it looks
It ain't like we're new to this
Slow down, let me give you a kiss
Baby come, gonna take my time
Lay back and let your body recline

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah, Dudes with no teeth are like, free sixchty
If I got kidnapped they'd say, Free 60
I brush my teeth with colgate, 360
I only play the Xbox, 360
Yeah that's right, Bill Gates did a guest spot
But I'm sueing him for not putting me in the press shots
I'll change my rap name to thingymabob
So it sounds weird when anybody's givin' me props
(Hey, thingymabob's dope) yeah this kid is a fox
I'm so good I mack girls while I'm flipping em' off
Only big in Australia, Like Erin Mcnaught is
Nah, I'm fucking universal banging Jennifer Hawkins
And cats say that I'll never make it platinum
So I'll buy my shit enough times to make it happen
The Aussie scene will probably hate my rappin'
Cause really I'm a pommy, I just fake my accent

[Hook]

[Interlude: 360]
Yeah, hey Joel
Do you reckon you could just
Let the beat play for a little bit man
I'm gonna whip out my Yazz flute and show
Ron Burgundy how to do it
Hey check this out, ready?

[Verse 3: 360]
You all envy me, I'm rap's MCG
Cos that's where I like to walk my pet TV, ""good boy""
I gotta say this is the best CD ""? vagina pussy""
I'm the MVP, I'll be chillin' at the barber shop
Trying to have a threesome with Tara Moss and
Lara Croft, ""Womb Raider""
I'm gonna tell you why I'm hard to stop
You know why?, Its cos my motherfuckin' cars a dog
And he's silent looking for a parking spot
That's the only time you'll ever hear his barking stop ""silence""
I'm at the vet clinic, tryin' to book my next visit
For my pet midget,for havin' sex with it
Chillin with black panthers, coppin lap dances
""get the fuck out bitch, you don't meet my fat standards!""
I'm a passionate rapper I'm Matt candid
In every interview I do, I only rap answers

[Outro: 360]
So 360, where did you grow up?
Hey yo Melbourne
Ok and ah how long have you been rapping for?
Yeah, yo, about 14 years
Hahaha yeeeees
Ask your mother cos she knows it
She's seen it, she's done it
She's lived it and she's loved it
That's how it goes bitch, 360
Recognise, Identify or step aside
Motherfucker, ok

[Round 1: Justice]
I'm gonna take everyone back to Scribble in '05
I went into that shit with like little to no lines
I came up against The Saurus and shit on him both times
Now he's got a vendetta and he's bitter with no pride
I seen the evolution of The Saurus, you going from A to A
The way you rapped five years ago, you rap the same today
And after I beat you in '05 and gave you a pat on the back
I caught him back stage crying in Illmaculate's lap

[360]
Who the fuck brought Newman from Seinfeld?
You know you're fat when you can use a hula hoop as a tight belt
And you two look like some [?] right now
Why the fuck are you even hear you should be moving some guy's couch

[Justice]
If you got to your nearest library and walk and around and look
You'll find Madness and The Saurus, I ain't talking 'bout the book
Look, this is not the natural path that evolution takes
Freddy Krueger's face, seven human's waists

[360]
If you think that Kramer's harsh, '60 can get racist hard
But I won't come with race remarks cause I can't tell what race you are

[Round 1: Madness]
Alright, so like 360 is like, ""I can't tell what race you are.""
I can't tell your either but I know living with AIDS is hard

[The Saurus]
I just wanna wonder how long you pre-rehearsed
Cause I've rapped the same since '05 and you rap even worse
Yo Decoy said we battled the best team on the entire circuit
So for the last month I've been writing verses for Prime and Purpose
This dude is a bitch
You look exactly like this one rapper who used to exist
Won Scribble, had one shot at a future and missed

[Madness]
You little prick
And you're just a faggot
You think you can really see a team of The Saurus and Madness?
Y'all probably live action role play the whole day, think you can transform into dragons
And porn has good acting

[The Saurus]
Us losing doesn't normally happen so I hope you're preparing to die
When I won Scribble after you I thought we'd be on a path to parallel lives
Come to find out, no one in this own country cares for this guy
Cause he apparently tries to rap so Americanized

[Round 2: Justice]
Before The Saurus said, ""Why'd you retire, you ain't been battling in years?""
That means you think battling is an actual career
What a dickhead, the biggest faggot that you'll hear of
His daughter's first words were, ""Daddy get a real job.""

[360]
You just made it clear that your appetite is great
It must fucking suck having that apple pie face
Aye Saurus, maybe next year when it's Valentine's Day
Don't give your missus a card full of battle rhymes, eh

[Justice]
How'd your mother give birth to a man of Snuffleupagus girth?
The pussy would've stretched so wide it would've covered the Earth
For real you can fit a man in a truck inside of Madness's gut
And still have room to fit in a fucking passenger bus
And Jabba The Hut

[Round 2: Madness]
He wants to talk about how my mother gave birth to me
Let me explain you in a better way
You look so fucking young you give a new meaning to the term 'born yesterday'
And you are both shit to me
You've been gone so long you probably still say ""lyrically""
I kill MC's, especially two that moonlight as Jim A and Mr. G
From Summer Heights
Yeah I see that you fucking right
And you probably bone your mum at night cause you live that Bad Boy bubby life

[The Saurus]
We battled five years ago but somehow you look like even less of a youngin
So I'm guessing that Justice's government name is Benjamin Button
And you faggots don't got a chance against an American made missile
You knew you'd get raped that's why you're wearing a rape whistle

[Madness]
360's interests are hair with the frostiest tips
Surf boards with the awesomest grips
You are both honestly shit
And let me reiterate, you don't want it with this

[Round 3: Justice]
I am Benjamin Button with the cycle that I'm aging
So when I'm 50 I'll fuck your daughter at her high school graduation
Yo, I'm half Chinese but I'm questioning my religion
Cause I can't tell if Buddah is Mexican or Sicilian

[360]
Yo, he likes to masturbate over beautiful large men
And he gets teary when he thinks of food in the past tense
And he reminds me of the little boy from 2 And A Half Men
Which is ironic cause he looks like two and a half men
Me and your fucking girlfriend we had a great affair
I had her laying there [?] Australian [?]

[Justice]
And fuck what you think you ain't the world rap champ
You a nerd rap fag like Dirtbag Dan

[Round 3: The Saurus]
I'm the world rap champ and this faggot never made it there
The only great affair you ever had was with his facial hair
I spit the great rap schemes
I'm just wondering, do those gay ass jeans come with an AIDS vaccine?
Hold up, there's some shit that needs an explanation
In WRC he was on a different team but were quick to leave and left him hanging
360's not a perfect circle so this would be the best equation
Minus 50 G's, Kevin Bacon needed Six Degrees Of Separation

[Madness]
And I'm just wondering
When you sold out and made the festival song
Did the contract say one of the requirements was to have your testicles gone

[The Saurus]
When you went to the prom I had sex with your mom listening to 'Let's Get It On'

[Madness]
Listen, Antedote was the first face that I seen and then you were next out of my window seat
[?] hiding in your hairline, cause I bet I could skydive off of your fucking widow's peek

{Judges call for overtime}

[OT Round 4: Madness]
This cunt got his name because he wanted to change his living habits
So he took his life and did a 360, and yep, still a faggot
Yo, Dirt' was right you do look like that Microsoft Word paperclip
That ass shit
And I put a million stacks bitch that you got a herpe covered little ass dick

[The Saurus]
Yo, I guess today you came to be ruined
Don't be mad at me cause I made a living off of something you're afraid to keep doing
He said he'd fuck my daughter but the closest he gets to fucking women
Is when he's watching '60 in front of the mirror trying to tuck his dick in
Yo, and I know this motherfucker's a Stan
Cause he said, ""I'm never washing this again"" after touching my hand
I don't need none of my punches to land
Cause they're so skinny, these cunts couldn't stand in front of a fan

[Madness]
Now listen, listen, I will rape both of you broads until my cock's red
You teaming with Antedote looked like Gumby reuniting with one of the blockheads
Ayo, and I will fucking begin to start the murder
Better yet, you look like the reuniting of shark and surfer

[OT Round: 360]
I rap with a chip on my shoulder, blazing these fucking haters
He raps with a chip on his shoulder, in case he gets hungry later
Yo this faggot's a bit lost, I know why Madness is pissed off
Cause he can't figure out how to eat the SPAM in his in-box

[Justice]
Listen, this guy is massive on Youtube, not cause he's hardcore bitch
You are massive on Youtube cause it's the Star Wars kid
Check it out, I don't even give a shit about you I don't know what your name is
But I've known him for ages, it's Toady from Neighbors

[360]
Aye, this fat fuck would probably break a sweat at a game of chess
I'm surprised he doesn't take a step and break a leg
I will bust in your home and kidnap your daughter and shave her head
And play classical music while I powder lips and paint 'em red

[Justice]
These motherfuckers are both Greek and Italian
So don't expect shit to come from each of their albums
Cause the only decent epiphany to come from Greece or from Italy
Is that [?], Euripides and fucking pizza delivery

[Verse 1:]
If you don't know we were sent to kill
Some have mentioned and said we're ill
They don't know what our illness is
So we're left to just kill this shit
Take a look and see the armies forming
Hear the steps as we're marching forward
Fight back and just ask for more blood
One touch turn your arse to sawdust
We step from above
Burning our feet on the edge of the sun
Murder the streets in a way that it's never been done
Who said this ain't meant to be fun?
Pray to Jesus cause he's your savior
Right now not even he will save you
But at least you're gonna meet your maker
Tell him that 60 said hi, I will see you later

[Hook:]
What if you were to know a killer, killer?
What if you were to know a killer, killer?
How would you feel to know a killer, killer?
What if I was a killer, killer?

[Verse 2:]
You can go ahead and judge me but
You don't know how good this feels
What it's like to be finally murdering something that should be killed
Yo, I gotta get my license to kill
So I'm down here to tighten my skill
If I spend the right time in the field
Then I know that I finally will
No more fear is inside of us
No laws here gonna apply to us
Better be aware, you'll be seeing your death bed
'Cause of us, a lot of people have slept there
This is intimidation, right?
The kingpins, you can face em
Gotta see there's a killing to be made
So it's off with their head, win win situation, killer

[Hook:]
What if you were to know a killer, killer?
What if you were to know a killer, killer?
How would you feel to know a killer, killer?
What if I was a killer, killer?

Killer, yeah, yeah, yeah
Killer, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro:]
Keeping time with the awesome view
Cause what you give (what you give)
Is coming backing to you
(how good)
It's 360
I had to get my partner in crime on this one
Everybody meet big lip Pez
Now this is my lead single, so you know it's good
How good, six? Pretty good, mate you know check it

[Verse 1: 360]
First of all these days are full of cliche, peak game
All you dudes need change
You need to rearrange, switch up your game plan
Dress like me in the dark with your Ray Ban's
All your clothes should be name brand (Stuss!)
And only go for girls with bleached hair and fake tan

[Verse 2: Pez]
Not me, I'm sipping liquor with vigour until I face plant
While I'm in this same stance, that's right, eighth can
You know the type you see acting like a cave man
Who hasn't got rhythm so he has to watch his mates dance
I'll be out till they close the city
You know I'm representing Dipper in my clothes from Dimmy's

[Verse 3: 360]
Yo, we think were top shit cause we're mates with the bouncer
We're walking straight through while it takes you an hour, ha-ha!
Where's the lynx, fuck taking a shower!
The girls are like cakes with their face full of powder

[Hook:]
(How good is your game?)
How good is your game? Just tell me (The game you play)
Forget following trends, we're not copying them
No way!
(How good is your game?)
How good is your game? Just tell me. (The game you play)
So so
If you're a stereotype then get to steppin' aside

[Verse 4: Pez]
I understand why you look all sad
Cause all the emos that we know just need hope
But I'm sick of cats all wearing these fitted hats, cause that stickers whack mate, you need to get rid of that

[Verse 5: 360]
Yo all that money that you spent wasn't worth it man!
Fuck fitted hats; me I'm more of a turban fan
My styles bummy, I shop around for worser brands
But fuck it up rockin' kicks that are worth a grand

[Verse 6: Pez]
You know the circumstance, get a bourbon and try to work a girl by returning her a nervous glance
She thinks that I'm a surfie with a perfect tan
So I tell her listen we're not rappers we're an urban band

[Verse 7: 360]
Yo we're the raver dudes flippin' out in purple pants
Chatting pig Latin for smoking on the herbal plants
Uck-fay, ou-yay! Monday, Tuesday!
Whose your favourite rapper, guys?
Kanye, Lupe! Ha-ha, it's not even!

[Hook:]
(How good is your game?)
How good is your game? Just tell me (The game you play)
Forget following trends, we're not copying them
No way!
(How good is your game?)
How good is your game? Just tell me. (The game you play)
So so
If you're a stereotype then get to steppin' aside

[Verse 8: 360]
I lose control when I groove to the beat
I swing my torso without moving my feet
And I like to nod my head if it's a suitable beat
With a nice smile showing off my beautiful cheeks

[Verse 9: Pez]
This dude, he can move and it's truly unique but see I'd rather get down counting my steps out
Cause I don't dance or even think of it brother
At my shows the whole crowd are walking into each other
I can't dance for shit
I can't stand or sit but it's clearly understood I walk really fuckin' good
So just trust me, don't test my walk, the rest all talk shit but when they step on the floor they get smoked

[Verse 10: 360]
Hey, you know he's doing the walk
It's no joke, yeah, so watch me do it some more
And nowadays everybody's looking the same
Ask yourself one thing; how good is your game?

[Chorus]
How good is your game?
(How good is your game? Just tell me.) The game you play
Forget following trends, we're not copying them. No way!
How good is your game?
(How good is your game? Just tell me.) The game you play
So so
If you're a stereotype then get to steppin' aside
How good is your game? How good is your game?

Now I feel that I
Won't be by your side
Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you
When I realised
This is my goodbye

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah, have you ever been dogged
By a best mate or even by a friend that you got?
Well, you been gettin' 'em wrong
They put a knife in your back to get ahead in their job
You been definitely gettin' 'em wrong
All this hatred, where the hell have they been gettin' it from?
Every time you succeed like you're settin' 'em off
It's like your life is somethin' that they're envious of
Don't get jelly when they win though
Anytime they're killin', go and cheer for 'em
Don't be happy when they get low
Hit 'em up and let 'em know you're here for 'em
Throwin' hands what you're gettin' ready for
Never been a friendship where there's never any flaws
In the rulebook there's forever been a clause:
'Never bring a life down just to get ahead in yours'
Yo, tell 'em

[Chorus: Hein Cooper]

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah, I know it hurts to get backstabbed
Your first reaction, you wanna go and stab back
It doesn't work, there's nothin' worse
It's undeserved, now they're spreadin' lies and it fuckin' hurts
They prob'ly did it out of vanity
What's killin', they were meant to be your family
The shit'll burn, but give 'em worse
Live and learn, swallow your pride and be the bigger person
That's the problem with friendly competition
Only gonna end as opposition
You don't ever wanna get in that position
Tell 'em but they never gonna listen
Yeah, if you do that's some shit that you'll regret it
Either isn't gonna end well or isn't gonna end
Forgive 'em, start wishin' 'em the best
'Cause while they prayin' that you fail, go and hit 'em with success
And kill 'em

[Bridge: Hein Cooper]
You gotta know, you gotta know
How you've betrayed me
And you oughta know, you oughta know
I hope you make it
Until you grow, until you grow
Out of this hatred
You'll never know, you'll never know
Until you change it

I'm sick of hearing all these others, yo, they're nothin' special
I don't understand why these little fucks respect you
What you sparking with? Why you lying, bitch?
I'm seeing life and it's gonna be a massive high
Why? Because I'm sittin' on a satellite
Bye, and I am ready for the action
Getting used to all the flashing lights, fuck being camera shy
So if you really think about it
We'd probably die without music, 360 can't live without
It's all expected to go and get a suit and tie
The way I see it, that is death or mental suicide
Where I come from, rappin' ain't a real job
But I have to do it, if I don't then I feel lost
They say invest in some real prospects
But we only live once though so really, what's the real cost?

I know that I'm alive so I'll always live a happy life
What up people? I really hope you're feelin' good
It's been a fucking great day so you really should
But if anybody telling you to fuckin' quit
Even to the fuckin' chicks tell 'em all to suck your dick

Oh-oh
If they wanna even talk they can go ahead and bring it on
No-oh
If they standing in my way, I don't care, I'ma kill 'em all
I'ma kill 'em all
I'ma kill 'em all
I'ma kill 'em all

[Verse 3: 360]
Yeah, I'm now working at building to make the flow more ether
We got no ceilings, but no floors either
Staring at the sky, always seem to be countin' sheep
But every sheep just never seems to amount to sleep
I'm in a room doin' lines of coke with a Dane chick
While you're with your best mate fightin' over the same bitch
I'm getting faded while drivin' slow in the Matrix
And after every show, I'm flyin' home in a spaceship

(I used to give a fuck)
(You know, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less)
(I used to give a fuck)

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
While we're on that subject
I'm pissin' off the fuck-heads and puttin' 'em in such stress
Cause everything I want in life I haven't even done yet
I set 'em off, line 'em up then I get across
Anything that you hate about me is everything that you're jealous of
Like tennis courts, and centre-folds
Everything that you never got, I just went ahead and bought
King, I'm the motherfuckin' ruler God
Obey Six: motherfucking rule of God
My suit is on, come and check for that new Vuitton
Every day up at Vue De Monde, that's they type of food I'm on

[Hook]
I don't care what you say
If you're not behind me, stay the fuck out my way
I'm livin', no speed limits
(You know, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less)
(I used to give a fuck)
(You know, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less)
(I used to give a fuck)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck-head the finger
Who's upset that I bunk bedded their sister
Some said that they're bitter, then come check me and get up
They talk about me then walk around me, they can't step to the winner
I'm ahead of my time, bet I'll be crossing the enemy's line
They forfeit, they try to rhyme but they force it
I'm awesome, they awkward
Talking about me in forums but when they see me it's all good
If haters wanna talk about me ya'll should
Promote my name whether love or hate, it's all good
Whatever you say it doesn't affect me, ya gettin' me payed
Just remember the name, at the end of the day

[Hook]
I don't care what you say
If you're not behind me, stay the fuck out my way
I'm livin', no speed limits
(You know, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less)
(I used to give a fuck)
(You know, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less)
(I used to give a fuck)

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah, listen
I ain't the type that'd ever choose lovemaking
But with you though it's something that I love making
And when we do I don't feel the need to fuck around
'Cause the sex is so good and I love it now
I been partying for days, baby, come around
'Cause the sex is my wings while I'm coming down
I'm prepared to do whatever you want
Give you everything of me, but the neck is the spot
I start at, move south as I head to the spot
With the muscle in my mouth, I'm connecting the dots
Yeah, hip grinding, lip biting, ignited
I'm feeling like I'm in flight inside ya
I can't finish first, that ain't never fair (Yeah)
Let me make you win, 'cause that respect is there
And if you ain't the type that'll climax
I promise I'll do anything to get you there, yeah

[Chorus: James Blake (Sampled)]
I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreaming anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Might as well fall in

[Verse 2: 360]
It's the love that we're making
And when it's heated I honestly won't leave you marks
(Nah) And if we're doing our thing and then I grab on your neck
Ayo, I promise I won't squeeze too hard
See it started with the sex, only getting off
But now I can't really tell if this is sex or not
I know I haven't asked you at all
But can you feel what I feel? Are you starting to fall?
Listen, I ain't saying that I love you
And I ain't worrying at all if you don't love me
But I ain't saying I don't trust you
It's just that where I'm at in my life, yo, I don't trust me
Yeah, I'm unsteady, wasn't ready for this right now
I feel heavy, I'm stressing, ain't ready to be tied down
Like G said, I might be overanalysing
But I'm so over analysing

[Chorus 2: James Blake (Sampled)]
I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreaming anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Falling
I don't know about my love
I don't know about my loving anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Might as well fall in
I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreaming anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling

I don't know about my dreams

[Intro - spoken]
Hello?
(Hello, Six, what ya doin'?)
Oh, just Facebook man
(Yeah, right, what ya doin' tonight?)
Just Facebook man
(Um, so, should come out Saturday, it's gonna be sick)
Nah, I got plans ay
(Yeah, ah, what are you doing?)
Just probably Facebook man
Hahahahaha

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm a motherfucking Facebook fiend
Fuck Myspace, it's FB
So if you want someone to talk to, befriend me
Yo, I got four-thousand friends but I'm out for more
And I won't stop until I get another thousand more
I deleted one girl, she had a duck face
And this awkward lean that made me wanna smash and chuck plates
I had to block this angry nutcase (Why?)
That's because your status updates are wack as fuck, mate
Why you do that tag?
If you tag me in a pic that ain't mine then I'll remove that tag, gone
If you know people to add, go and SMS them
'Cause I find this is the best way to get attention
I don't care about the clubs and events your sending
I just care about the friends that you're recommending
Yo, I wanna sit there all day friend requestin'
And if they ask why, I'll blame it on my friend suggestions

[Break 1 - spoken]
""Dear Veronica
Thank you for accepting my add
No, I don't know you, but you look pretty cute, aye?
If you're from Melbourne, I was just wondering if you would like to get together and have a lime milkshake with me one time
Cheers babe""

[Verse 2]
Yo, I know there's others out there who wanna co-sign this
Now we lucky that we got it on our mobiles, sick
You can see me in some pictures but I don't smile, bitch
And I always give the fingers in my profile pics, yeah
And that's a fact unless I'm taking an ab shot
And I'm a screamer, I'm always writing in caps lock
And I'm a nerd in real life but I'm thuggin' on my laptop
So if you wanna fight, I got my gat cocked
I've got pictures of the bling that I wanna score
And I've got pictures of the rims on my Commodore
And fuck with me and you will see your funeral, blat
Check my arms out, Times Roman Numeral tatts
When it comes to hair, I only rock tips
I got 'em done in year 8 and they've been blonde since
I know you wanna be motivational, yo, but
Fuck you and your inspirational quotes, bitch

[Break 2 - spoken]
""Hey babe, I'm selfish, impatient, a little insecure
I make mistakes, I'm out of control and at times hard to handle
But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.""
Get fucked, I do not agree (Hahahaha)

[Verse 3]
Yo, to all my friends out there, yo, I'd like you to know this
Whether online or offline, I don't like to be poked, kids
But now I'm searching just to find me a hoe
But you ain't Kylie Minogue, so why you strikin' a pose?
Shit, she's hot, I wanna date that chick
But she got emo statuses, I fucking hate that shit (Ah, fuck!)
And let's be honest that's a dumb look, thank you
And all your pics are taken from an upwards angle
Listen, if we can tell you got a huge head now
Any time you meet a guy then it's a huge let down
You're hiding and you'll find that you're lying
While denying it as well, I can tell, so you're lying to yourself
Yo, I know you like to upload pics
But we wanna see you smiling from the front though, bitch
If there's one thing I learnt off Myspace
It's to never have a blind date with a girl who always likes to hide her face

[Outro]
""Excuse me, are you Matt?""
""Um, nup, nah, not me babe""

[Verse 1: Pez]
They got us all wondering in a brain fog
'Cause we been brainwashed since day dot
And while we face off to be their servants
They just sit behind the curtains and they play God and then wonder why we
Come through like ""fuck you""
'Cause they're the only words that cut through
Course are views become skewed
When all we ever get is untruths
So you living here in a world
That's so unjust it's hard to adjust to
But we just do, something we can't undo
It's at the point where everybody's gone insane
I try to tell 'em but it's all in vain
I'm thinking maybe we were born this way
'Cause there's always been this sufferin' on mother Earth
That's undeserved, in other words
We all been in turmoil ever since our birth on the hurt soil
It's come to a head now, but still we can't seem to get out
Because in our mind we been locked here inside
With this heave-ho with our ego
They like keep hopin' we'll decode but we don't
I really thought we're about some sort of spiritual awakenin'
I'm tryin' to figure if it's for real or if we're fakin' it
I just wanna know if it's a miracle or make believe
We do we all still feel so imprisoned if we're breakin' free?

(The choir)

[Pre-Verse: 360]
Yo
They ask me what's my goal, then they like ""what the fuck?""
'Cause I don't want the crown, for me that's not enough
I can see the future, I'm the best that's ever livin'
And I've got four years, that's twenty-twenty vision

[Verse 2: 360]
You see this rap shit's what I'm made for
Give the fans what they paid for
Hit the ground and I transform
This shit here's what I trained for
Keep risin', I stay strong
Keep fighting, I pace on
'Cause I realise that that hate's from
It's just having what they want
Always 'member where I came from
Never tellin' me to stay calm
If they lacking I don't wait for 'em
I just move ahead and then I pray for 'em
Listen to 'em when they make songs
And it's got me thinking where the taste gone
We can be the one to take on
And we'll go to where these rappers ain't gone
See they don't want you winning, they really love to talk
That's what we used to do, start screamin' ""fuck 'em all""
So here's the best advice, tell 'em that you love 'em all
That's what we exercise, the best reply is none at all

Amy!
Amy! Amy, you listening? Fuckin' hell!
You need to settle the fuck down
You're starting to lose your shit!
It's okay to party and have a bit of fun and shit
But you're fuckin' just, you're going overboard
You're embarrassing me
You're embarrassing your fucking family and friends
Just chill the fuck out for a bit (God)

[Verse 1]
Okay, goddamn, Amy, Amy, Amy
I've been kind of embarrassed, yo, but who the fuck can blame me?
One day you love me, the next day you hate me
I'm sick of making all these damn excuses for you lately
I've been meaning to talk but I've had to pick the best times
It's not just the drugs though, you're rackin' up the headlines
You have a bump and start rackin' up the next line
And if we have to leave the house, you'll rack 'em up the next time
(Oh, we'll do that next time, yeah?) You're stupid if you think your folks won't know
Come on, let's leave the house, Am', the coke won't go
(Come on, really?) But, really yo, I'm sorry for that low, low blow
I took your arse to rehab, you're like ""No! No! No!""
Yeah, you need to make a suitable choice
Get off the crackie and try and save that beautiful voice
Just stop and think for a minute, yo, you're Amy Winehouse, baby
Just don't overdo it, I'd hate it for you to die now

Where's my moral parallel?

[Verse 2]
Fuck yeah, Amy, Amy, Amy
The trashiness aside, in the bed, you go crazy
Honestly, I can't get enough of it lately
I'm all for a girl who loves to fuck me like they hate me
Yeah Amy, I fuckin' love you, baby
We've had a non-stop party since the remix with Jay-Z
Yeah, I mighta said it, having drugs is trouble, son
But, while you're up babe, can you rack me up another one?
I ain't done shit, yo, I'm lappin' up the summer fun
Being a fuckin' trashbag, it has me stuck like bubblegum
Yeah, now she's got me equally as trashbag
Walking London streets with half a bottle of Jack Dan's
Having people sayin' maybe I should lie down
Fuck out of my face, I'm all over the high now (You don't fuckin' know me)
I just hope we don't overdo it and die now
But I could give a fuck, as long as I'm in the wine house

(Fuck yeah, I fuckin' love this shit) Although I've been here before
(I love this life) Amy, Amy, Amy (No reality whatsoever)

'Bout to have another episode
It ain't as easy as letting go

Been asleep for weeks, in the same fucking set of clothes
In my house, but I'm never home
Barely got the energy to write a fucking letter, no

Which sick am I, can you let me know?
Bipolar and skitzo, trust that I get 'em both
All this medication, I feel like I'm gettin' slow
Talkin' to a shrink but I'm never gettin' better though

Or no more pills that I'm forced to swallow
If I'm tapping out don't fuck around with me

Uh, yeah
Get down with fucking trap arms and shit, nah
I'm not gonna rap like a young thug on this shit, ayy
Ayy

[Verse]
I've got broads in Dromana who listen to Korn and Nirvana
There's plenty of fish, I went and caught a piranha
Don't jump the gun
Listening to this shit'll pump you up
Shit's so raw but it's never underdone
Your top five better have six number one
But I'm proud as fuck if I swallow it
Better be getting ready for stomach pump
If I leave it, I better get a tummy tuck
Not ready to be a rapper with a chubby gut, no
I'm the highest I have ever gone
On a level you were never on
In the best shit I have ever worn
All I'm hearing's ""where'd you get it from?""
This isn't cute
Rappers are terrible, this is the truth
I'm thinking this shit so I'm thinking of you
Like ""what the fuck have I been listening to?""
In the studio, they rock up
They walk in, they're like ""what's up?""
Find them a beat where the drop's tough
And spend a minute in the shit like ""job done!""
It's like damn, you and your man
All you be thinking when making your jams
Kicking catchphrases and making a slam
Think of words that they can say in their chant
Know it's working so you cater to fans
Fuck 'em all, you? I'll be making a stand
See that label? They will pay your advance
Stab you in the back while shaking your hand
See to them? Real shit's corny
They don't listen to shit, they ignore it
Their condition to think that it's boring
They want that ignorant shit inapplaudded
Rather be hitting a lick, dick in a chick
Drinking at six in the morning
'Stead of political shit that is riddled with everything that you think isn't important
This is your warning, smarten up
Say how you feel, they're like harden up
All I want, a culture that's hard as fuck
In order to do that, they target us (wooh)
The powers to be they not being honest
American radio got them some bosses
And look at the prisons, he got ‘em some stock in (wooh)
Why? When prisons are filling the stock hits a rocket
So, what is the logical model to fill all them pockets with dollars? It's gotta be obvious
What is a prominent topic of all of the songs at the top is
They talk of a life in a popular genre
They glorify crime and they want you to want it
They don't want your conviction, they want you as convicts
Even provide you that rock in your pocket
But they are the ones who are profiting from it (wooh)
The cops on the block, they don't want you to want it
Their jobs are more promised when locking up convicts
You go to prison, you top up their wallets (yeah)
You learning that life is not what you wanted
So, when you get out, you promise to stop it
Because of your past, you not get a job again (nah)
Apologies, sorry, I gotta be honest
You needing to eat, you gotta get dollars
You're forced to go out on the block and just hock again
I sorry to say they don't want you to change
What good are morals? There's dollars to make
The US of A, convict anonymous (yeah)
I sorry to say they  want you to change
What good are morals? There's dollars to make

We can't just live what we think in our thoughts
We're gonna have to dig till we dig to the core, or
Everything that we're ever gonna give
I'll only ever wanna give a little more, more
Now we got a lot of push behind it
We ain't even gonna look behind us
There's a place that is put inside us
And now we're both knowing where to look to find it (yeah)
See we don't need a book to guide
But it can act as good reminder
Why're you acting we could well find our dream
'Cause I know that we should, that's why I

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego (360)]
If I seem naive

Force your hand
Oh-oh-oh—oooh

Oh-oh-oh—oooh
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah

[Verse 3: 360 & Pez]
See there's times where you're hiding
Times where your mind isn't clear
See even though you're excited, feeling inspired
Still you get blinded by fear
Now we got it yo, it's finally here
Can't believe it, it's like we've been fighting
For years, there's no better timing
It's been an upwards climb our entire career
See these people, they all around ya
No matter what you do they're gonna always doubt ya
See the haters wanna call us out, but
Compared to the love they're a small amount, uh
That's the reason we keep our distance
We know who we are, we don't need to listen
They're always gonna feel the need to diss
But they don't mean it so please forgive them

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
If I seem naive
I would never want to
Force your hand
Oh-oh-oh—oooh
If I seem naive
I would never want to
Force your hand
Oh-oh-oh—oooh
Oh-wow-wo-woah

[Verse 1: GMC]
Yo
They used to say, ""If you aim for the win, you hit the top of the tree""
If you aim for the top of the tree, you never leave the ground
So my path is much more than just me and now
I gotta risk falling if I ever wanna reach the clouds
Sometimes branches don't feel steady
Sometimes your man just don't feel ready
I can feel edgy but still jump in the
Unknown and not ask for answers, I don't need any
I don't know how it's supposed to be done
Livin' my life between both the rose and a gun
Destiny hints to me that it's chosen the one
That's why I fly till I float too close to the sun
And if I fall and come back down from the high
I'll turn around 'cause I can't back down from the sky
'Cause I remain faithful, even when I'm dying
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying

[Chorus: GMC]
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying

[Verse 2: 360]
Uh, yo, people ask what I wish for
Man, I wish that everybody on this Earth would just wish more
We could wish for some better things
But I'm grateful to even be grateful for anything
And that don't mean I don't walk on the edge
'Cause I'll be doing anything I want till I'm dead
I do what needs to be done to feel contentment
In a hope that I live a life with no regretment
Hungry ain't even a word to describe me
I'm starving, that's the proper term that defines me
Even at the highest of highs, I'm still climbing
Swimmin' in the clouds with the stars, where you'll find me
Remain faithful, even when we're dying
'Cause even when we're falling we're flying
We must remain faithful, even when we're dying
'Cause even when we're falling we're flying

[Chorus (Extended): GMC]
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying

[Intro: 360]
Uh
Yeah

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah, can you keep a secret, dude?
We'll keep this shit, between me and you
I've only ever told one person, my girlfriend
So i thought i'd go and let the world in
Look, brother, I love ya, but we're a health risk
Using false wings to escape where no-one else lives
We can't help this
But I'm making myself sick
At how you and I are always making ourselves sick
It's like the drugs are the only thing that'll help this
Really it's that shit in our past we haven't dealt with
I'm scared if it was something I dealt with
I'd be in a cell or have my arm where the belt is
Cause I'd find where that motherfuckers house is
Ask where he got the cards in a hand that he dealt us
Hey yo, I'm sorry if that's selfish
I just ain't afraid to say the shit that no-one else is

[Chorus: Sam Bruno]
Please don't let me go
I'm hanging by a thread
You don't know this but I need you
To save me from myself
Or give me something else
To live for cause I'm dying slowly

[Verse 2: 360]
Listen, yo, this is the mindset i called in
While chasing after your dream
When you needed more sleep you gotta stay awake
If you want to make it a sure thing
When life gives you the short string
Confusion is the core thing
Spend time just wondering what it all means
If somebody could guide me, by all means
I had to put the bottle down
And the pills, i don't pop em' now
Always escaping from what got me down
Blocking out a memory i'm wishin' i had forgot about
They wanting my singles to be playful
Light hearted fun shit that young kids relate too
No-one wants to know about the planet i escaped to
As therapy i used to get rid of something painful

[Chorus: Sam Bruno]
Please don't let me go
I'm hanging by a thread
You don't know this but I need you
To save me from myself
Or give me something else
To live for cause I'm dying slowly

[Verse 3: 360]
Don't take this song as me complaining but
I know that I'm saying crazy stuff
My close friends are always telling me i say too much
But those that have been through it tell me I'm brave as fuck
I'm sorry if I'm rambling, it helps me out of the bottomless pit that I crash landed in
I've never quite understood why the self-destructive me
Is always sabotaging something good
I was out of control, not all there
Destroying my body, with not a care
Now i understand everything that got me there
In a dark tunnel trying to find a light that wasn't there

[Chorus (Extended): Sam Bruno]
Please don't let me go
I'm hanging by a thread
You don't know this but I need you
To save me from myself
Or give me something else
To live for cause I'm dying slowly
Please don't let me go
I'm hanging by a thread
You don't know this but I need you
To save me from myself
Or give me something else
To live for cause I'm dying slowly

[Verse 1]
Ay yo I hardly read the shit up on my Facebook wall-posts
Cause some kids are gonna hate me although
I read one from a kid who was in his teens
How he hated life and he didn't have shit to be
He couldn't take it, he hated this place
And he was gonna kill himself but didn't because of me
Yeah, I ain't a saint and I ain't perfect
But posts like that make the hate worth it
People say the fame hurts of change
All I've done is grown up, your still looking at the same person
If my views can re-arrange your beliefs, oh
If my songs can be saving a teen, yeah
If my words go and change how you think
Then I'ma make 'em believe in chasing in dreams
You see that rock I'ma land on it soon
And be the motherfucking man on the moon

[Hook]
Keep my head above the ground
I know the time is only now
And we can part the clouds and pave the path that
No one else has ever run
And I know it’s time to ride the moon and chase the sun
And we can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want but I don’t wanna live a lie

[Verse 2]
Making music is nothing like working a job
People think I ain't deserving this spot
Being real yo, I know that I deserve it because
I worked my arse off so I feel I've earned what I've got
See me battle different rappers, always serve 'em a lot
Try to clown, bring 'em down taking personal shots
Then a certain response
Made me understand when I said faggot really how hurtful it was
I didn't mean to offend at all
But those stabs I won't have in my vocab anymore
I ain't standing here defending myself, just to gain new fans, I'm trying to better myself
I'm trying to better the world, I rap to get my point across
I used to be the dude you'd avoid a lot
Now I'm making a living out of my voice
Staring out at the stars and the moon and playing join the dots

[Hook]
Keep my head above the ground I know the time is only now
And we can part the clouds and pave the path that
No one else has ever run
And I know it’s time to ride the moon and chase the sun
And we can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want but I don’t wanna live a lie
Keep my head above the ground
I know the time is only now
We can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want but I don’t wanna live a lie

[Verse 3]
Ay yo I never just thought that I'd be anything more
Than a shitty rapper filling out a Centrelink form
On a level I thought I could never be on
Addicted to natural highs like when I perform
Got out the hole that they buried me in
Got sober, more grateful now than anyone is
I wouldn't change any of this, if I can have whatever I wish
Cause I'm stronger now than I ever have been
I don't wanna preach, but the message is this
The past happened, if it sucks then accept that it did
The past is all mental, in your head it exists
So live in the present and then it won't effect you a bit
Channel all my energy to capture the moon
Had it keep revolving and naturally grew
See that rock in the sky I'ma land on it soon
And be the motherfucking man on the moon

[Hook]
Keep my head above the ground
I know the time is only now
And we can part the clouds and pave the path that
No one else has ever run
And I know it’s time to ride the moon and chase the sun
And we can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want
But I don’t wanna live a lie
But I don’t wanna live a lie
But I don’t wanna live a lie
But I don’t wanna live a lie

[Intro: PEZ]
Yeah, for all the festival-heads
Check it out

[Verse 1: PEZ & 360]
All right, it’s that
Time of the year you’ve been waiting for for months now
Saving up your pay, tryna figure all your funds out
It's kind of funny when you think of all the fun how
It's taken this long to shake last year's come down
Forget the past, as soon as December starts
Grab your parents' credit card and hope that you don’t get in last
Yeah, 'cause if you let it pass, these days a week late
Can mean paying triple when you BPAY off eBay (True)
It's hard to figure out what tickets you want
Should it be Falls Festival or Pyramid Rock?
Well for me, I really don't care 'cause I don’t listen to rock
Nor hip-hop, I just wear earplugs and sit there and watch
If your favourite band's there, you’ll think you’ll never forget
You’ll probably get that wasted, you won't remember their set
If you're a festival head, then you already know the plan
Go and pack up all your shit, 'cause you're going on a trip

[Chorus: PEZ & Hailey Cramer]
For those summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days
For those summer days
I love summer days

[Ad-Libs/Collision: PEZ]
""Man I'm not squishing in the back
I'm telling you, shotgun front""
""Nah, bullshit man""

[Verse 2: PEZ & 360]
Now when you finally make it there
From driving up with your crew
You better get your mind set on finding something to do
'Cause you’ll be stuck there lining up in a queue
Moving bumper-to-bumper until your arse hurts
All to get your car searched
Yeah, and with your alcohol
You're stressing 'cause you need it bad
Stashing bottles of vodka up in your sleeping bag (That's right)
Maybe get a spare tyre with a heap of cans
It doesn’t matter, everybody has their secret plan
Once you're through, start picking your spot
Unpack and realise all the things you forgot, or shit that you lost
(Man, I swear I brought my pillows and socks)
And dudes are too excited, already sitting there sloshed
You know it doesn’t take long
Before you find somebody blazing up
""Mate, what are you doing?
I said to save the bud for Xavier Rudd!""
And it's always the cheap fuckers who ain’t paid enough
But please note that we don’t condone taking drugs

[Chorus: PEZ & Hailey Cramer]
Summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days

[Ad-Libs/Collision: PEZ]
""Man, how cold is it inside this tent?!""
""I know, it's freezing, man, Jesus Christ""

[Verse 3: PEZ & 360]
Now as soon as the sun rises you’ll be ready to start
At six o’clock, standing there outside your tent with a glass
You're in it for the long haul, it doesn’t end when it's dark
We all know you’ve got your friends to make your energy last
And you gotta time it so you're peaking while the acts play
Try and jump the fence and start sneaking into backstage
(Man, let's just do it, who cares?)
If you get caught by police then try to act straight
""Nah, they're not those pills, I need 'em for my back pain""
And dudes are flying, saying to their mates, ""I love you, man!""
Or on a walk so they can go
And call their mum and dad (That's PEZ)
And then there’s people who so desperately just need a friend
They're going up to anybody, tryna have a D&M (Yeah, my family)
The next stage is you won't even watch the bands live
You're having too much fun talking shit around your campsite
Gettin' wasted while you bake in the sun
What can I say, yo? It's a fuckin' good way to get drunk

[Chorus: Pez & Hailey Cramer]
I love summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days

[Ad-Libs/Collision: PEZ]
""Hey, what happened to you guys last night?""
""I didn't even hear the countdown or anything""

[Verse 4: PEZ]
Now by the last day you're probably thinkin' summer's the worst
'Cause all that time out in the sun left you covered in burns
And smothered in dirt, the sight of all the dunnies is worse
And all the food shops are gone when you're so hungry it hurts
All you wanna do is sleep but you got packin' to do
Then squash up in that car and jump back in a queue
Yeah, I know we all complain about the pain when it ends
But next year we’ll save up and do the same shit again

[Chorus: PEZ & Hailey Cramer]
I love summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days, summer days
Summer days
Summer days
I love summer days
Summer days
Summer days
I love summer days

[Ad-Libs/Collision: PEZ]
I was gonna say I love festivals
Didn't really have the same ring to it though
Yeah
PEZ, 360
Of course Matik on the beat
Yeah
Play that shit loud

Tap me on the shoulder and she feeling all up on me
Must of left a good impression, probly 'cause I ain't stressing

When I ain't home she calling on phone
Or leaving messages, she won't leave alone
I don't wanna cut her off, so I just don't hit her back
Then I hit her when I need her and I lay down the facts
I know that sound harsh, in some ways cruel

So when I talk to you I only tell the truth

[Intro]
It's 360, we're gonna play a bit of rapper tag
So usually in a rap cypher, there's a circle of rappers
There's the guy rapping, and the next guy next to him is the person to go next
So seeing as we're not in a circle right here and it's just like a YouTube cypher, you have to call out the person you want to go next
So I'ma start this off

[Verse]
It's 360, we about to play rapper tag
So I need to know where about's the rapper's at?
You hear the beat in the drums, it's a massive track
So if I mention your name then you have to rap
Three months ago I crashed in a Go Kart
It's cause I'm so fucking good that I don't park
So don't ask how real is that
But I ain't talkin' Go Karts when I kill this track, like
I had a problem with my balls, yo, you don't know what
Some had thought it would be Photoshopped
Yo, I woke up this morning like I'm RoboCop
Stormed outside to go and make my Coco Pops
Yeah, chocolate cereal, gangster shit
Mum poured me the cereal, I said 'thank you, bitch'
Nah I didn't, don't think I'm a G
Yo, I said 'thank you mum' and gave a kiss on the cheek, yeah

[Outro]
Boom son! Rapper tag! I'm calling out - I'm calling out old mate Urthboy. You're next - you're next bro. Don't leave it hanging too long. And then you tag the next person you want to go after you and so on and so forth. Alright, peace out

I keep tellin' 'em ""As God as my witness
Who I'm runnin' with is none of your business""
'Cause fuck it, I'm the same as you
I can't wait until I'm free of ya
I keep tellin' 'em ""As God as my witness
I'll be damned if I'ma pray for forgiveness""
'Cause fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

[Verse 1]
I wish my grandpa could see me now
I wonder, would he be disgusted? Would he be proud?
It ain't about the choices that you shouldn't've made
It's about what you did when they couldn't been made
See I'm dancin' with the devil, one foot in the grave
The eyes are windows to your soul, take a look at my pain
It's all about the risks that you lookin' to take
And fuck what anybody says, yo, it's good to be brave
Focus on the positives, don't look at mistakes
I shoulda been a failure if you look at my grades, ayy
Feel that inner zen, in a sense
Innocence is just a lack of inner sense, mmm
I don't rate success in the numbers I am paid
I rate it from people just tellin' me their lives were saved
Wasn't the person the media would try to paint
Haters read the headlines, fans read the entire page

Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too
Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

[Verse 2]
Yo
There's a monster growin' in me, and I have to feed it
The last one to go, the others though I have defeated
I'm self-destructive, perhaps I need it
I know deep down I gotta do everything that I can do beat it
I don't have the key, it's locked away deep inside
My chest in a place I hate goin' so I have to leave it
I don't know if I ever can gather the strength
To grab it and face up to it and get my hand to reach it
Every time I just lose my fuckin' mind
Whilst it stands over me again and again and I'm trapped beneath it
So maybe I never can and that's the reason
I portray this image of a better man when I haven't been him
It goes back to when I was a child
Life is meant to be all smiles
Instead it took away my innocence, where everything in life
Became negative and ever since it I keep tellin' 'em
""As God as my witness""

[Chorus]
Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too
Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

There has been a lot of tension between 360 and Kerser, but no actual problem. The fans of both 360 & Kerser have made this problem, by being to opposites of people. The first recorded shot been thrown was by Kerser on his song - Slam Dunk, from his underground mix tape - Down The Drain, in which he quoted:

""Uses are scared little b*tches like Pez and 60""

A year later after fans of each other go at it. 360 than later comes out with a video, he later comments on it as:
""I put up a video just full clowning on him and shit like that, just to build up the anticipation for the battle and than yea... It happened"".

Kerser was making himself a name in the battle rap scene, and so was 360. There was a lot of hype between the two battling, with the first battle going to be with  360 & Pez vs Kerser & Hyjak around mid year 2011, but it didn't happen for reasons untold.

Eventually a battle was made, but it was only between Kerser & 360, and was uploaded on YouTube on the 4th of January - 2012. It got a huge 2.1 million views as of 2014 and being by far the highest viewed battle in Australia. The battle just only built the tension between 360 and Kerser fans.

Kerser has had his say in the comparisons, on the songs - I Ain't Leaving, & Deadset 3.

""Cambelltown they say its rare and shitty,
I am a street motherf*cker don't compare me to 60'.""

On the 3rd of July 2013 Kerser posted his song - Left Em All Stranded, to the the Aus Hip Hop Forums.

360 commented on the forum:

""looking forward to peeping this
keep killing it bruv
edit - i actually am too busy to peep right now but i definitely will""

Little did he know that Kerser had thrown another shot at him on that track:
""Got the new album comin' that's three from three
You been workin' on your EP shit for years""

This may of sparked a bit of competition in 360 to come back with the song on the 9th of August - 30 Minutes Tops, which Kerser and his fans believed to be a shot at him.

Where he quoted:
""Brother, don't take it as a lack of respect.
I am glad I made your career have a tad of success,
but I just had to address something something that has to be said,
A snapped neck doesn't need snapping again.
Do I think I won that battle? Actually yes.""

He also quoted:
""Not another f*ckin rapper again,
Kickin me another verse without his pad or his pen,
Asking me when me and kerser are f*ckin battling next,
I am sorry buddy, but that ain't going happen again.""

Though when Kerser was asked on the fort nightly report he was asked, when are you going to battle 360 next? Kerser than replied ""When he picks his ball up"". Another shot fired, hopefully there is another rap battle?

Shortly after the release of 30 Minutes Tops, Kerser replied with the song - Old Matt. It was released on the 12 of August.

Both sides has said there is no beef, on the fellow rapper of Kerser - YouTube series the 'Fort Nightly Report', hosted and created by the rapper Fortay.

[Verse 1:]
Yo, He tries to stay positive, living in a dead town
He can't keep his head up, he has to keep his head down
He only sees ahead now, the loneliness has left
And he's focused and he's over being left out
He don't need anyone now, he's giving everything now
Look in his eyes and see it's evident now
When he, told himself he would never be left in the ground
For those who told he would never be anything now
He's known what he wants want he grows up
He'll do anything it takes, 'cause it means so much
And it's his ego telling him he sees no love
But now he sees it's irrelevant, he needs no one
But see, as he's chasing up the outline
He found a plane he created to take him from the downtime
And as he wait for it to land, when he makes it up to cloud nine
All he's gonna say is it's about time

[Hook:]
Now that I’m all inn, I hear em calling up again (calling up)
I knew the moment that I was flying, I’d be there (calling up)

[Verse 2:]
And from the start though, they always tried to single him out
It was hard though, it almost started bringing him down
And now he laughs at attemps it’s always peaking him out
But now they can’t he ain't listening now (he ain't listening now)
They use to hit him, it would shit him so he’d fight back
And then he stopped once he figured out thy liked that
He knows exactly what it’s like to be the underdog
Words had led him thinking an surprised him at the fucking top
And now they got him, he’s backed in a corner, he’s trapped
But if he starts to relax he’s a goner
In fact, he doesn’t wanna be that kid at all
And they talk, but now he doesn’t hear that any longer
He’s fighting to make a million
Hiding away and feeling
He’s trying to make a killing but he’s dying to make a living
And now he’s knowing it’s a state of mind
Hoping in his day and time maybe he’s finding that place within him

[Hook:]
Now that I’m all inn, I hear em calling up again (calling up)
I knew the moment that I was flying, I’d be there (calling up)

[Verse 3:]
And he sees the big picture, what’s the point in being narrow minded?
The ladders high, but he’s knowing that he has to climb it
All the shit he’s sacrificed, knowing what he has inside
He’s ready and he doesn't need a map to find it
It’s the muscle in his chest that he’s pumping all the blood until he’s dead
Knowing nothing will be left
And he can’t let it go, it’s hard to let it be
And you can call it pride, but he can’t accept defeat
And this for those who ain't got no voice
It ain't whether he can do it yo, he’s got no choice
Now he’s got his armor on, and they cannot stop him
Shoot what they want to, watch the bullets bounce of him
He finds it funny now that people had doubted him
Have a look and you’ll see that they’re around again
Because they know now (they know now)
They see him just standing in the corner with a smile as it goes down

[Hook:]
Now that I’m all inn, I hear em calling up again (calling up)
I knew the moment that I was flying, I’d be there (calling up)

Drop those panties, girl, show me your front bum
Can I get my sing on for you tonight, girl? Yeah, yeah
Yeah, I've been doing this for a while now
Finally starting to kick off

[Hook]
Doing my singing lessons, girl
(I do it on a regular week, yeah)
Ah yeah, doing my singing lessons, girl
(Every Tuesday night, 7:30, Dianne is her name)
Doing my singing lessons, yeah
(Yeah, Dianne is old but quite in tune with her spirit)
Doing my singing lessons, girl

[Verse 1]
Uh, all I wanted back then was some singing lessons
Mum got me five months as a Christmas present
Never would expect that I would sound smooth
Busting out all these notes but with no moves
The white Denzel, stylish as hell
Sometimes compared me to Tyrese as well
If you want some white chocolate, then I've got it
You'll see me singing around in your bifocals

Doing my singing lessons, girl
I'm doing my singing lessons, yeah

[Verse]
Have you ever not trusted yourself?
Or wished that you were somebody else?
Like you're barefoot running through hell?
There's nothing worse than a messy junkie with endless money
Especially one on an empty stomach that's getting hungry
I seem good, but lately I've been better, trust me
Tears up on a steel frame and I'm getting rusty
I'm from a good home, I'm knowing that my parents loved me
But it's like my dog's the only one who'll never judge me
One year clean, something that is hard to get
I give it everything, I put my fucking heart in this
You wanna know the hardest bit I nearly can't admit?
'Cause when I do I'm feeling like an narkie bitch
'Cause when I'm seeing friends I used to party with
I've had to cut ties 'cause I'm feeling like I can't resist
When you get clean, it's not drugs you've parted with
Friends and lifestyle are just as much a part of it
See I would love to catch up and have lunch
But when I see you, I just wanna rack up and that's fucked
Stop being angry and fucking mad
Are you a loose end, because a true friend would understand
Never force the progression of a soul
Give me time, let me get it in control
I'm doing well for someone that was never in control
Doing well for someone that was never in control
Let me get a hold on it and then we can evolve (Yeah)
See the devil on my shoulder's now embedded on my soul
Real friends

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me you want the tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on the FaceTime
Even when we was young we used to make time
Now we be way too fucked up to make time

[Chorus]
Ever fucked with real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, and throw dirt on him
I guess I get what I deserve

Yo, yo (Yes)
It's full throttle, I pull bottles
Smack your head in until you fools hobble
Yeah, with the H2GO, you're way too slow
With your gay new flow
Fuck youse, I love to win
Smash your head in with a rubbish bin
Check that ill shit, I kill shit
Here we go

[Verse 1: PEZ]
I'm a self-confessed psychopath, might attack
Any cats writin' raps till, inside, their eyes are black
Despise crowds, find out we'll fight loud
Right now, not hittin' switches but I'll put your lights out
The type of kid to beat you to death with a pencil case
And use your blood to see what picture the stencil makes
Kickin' back, spittin' raps, rip the tracks
So of course I'll split your back with a fuckin' cricket bat
I'll fake my death till doctors check the carcass
Escape during the autopsy just to run starkers
Through your block of apartments, full cravin' a chick
Both arms missin' but still wavin' my dick
I rap bars exactly tracks scarred
Sneak in your backyard, slap your mum's fat arse
For hanging clothes on the line, keep my flows in time
Fuck all of your thoughts, 'cause I'm imposing mine
Let's get this paper, dog, ""A4 or A3?""
Don't give a fuck what it is just as long as you pay me
Nah, I'm just jokin', not into flowin' with chains
All the bling shit's the reason why I'm goin' insane
It's expected, grab the mic and I wreck shit
Turn the tables on my life so my nickname's Techniques
Outkast won the Grammy but I wanna beat the boss
Big fights with stereos till I see the speaker box
And smash this shit till I leave it in the gutter
Yo, I'll crack your skull in with a jar of peanut butter
Or Vegemite, let us fight and I bet you might
Step aside 'cause every time I just wreck the mic

[Pre-Chorus: 360 & PEZ]
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da

[Chorus 1: 360 & PEZ]
I'm a fucking nutcase
I am, I am
Just a fucking nutcase
I'll cut off your nose (yes)

[Interlude: 360 & PEZ]
PEZ is talkin' about wavin' his dick
We'll get your grandma and wear duct tape on her lips
To make her my bitch
Yo, fuckin' breakin' her ribs and makin' her twitch
And I'll stick her in a grave in a ditch (yes)
We're fuckin' grazin' her skin and fuckin' shavin' her chin
Where's your daughter? I'm breakin' her in
Stick her fuckin' face in a bin (yeah)
Let the motherfuckin' rapin' begin
We're makin' her sing (ooh)
We're fuckin' namin' her Glinn (yes, yeah)
(Yes, fuckers) Figure it out
While lickin' her out, I'll stick my dick in her mouth
And she'll get fuckin' shived on her couch
We want a drunk chick, Kylie Minogue type with one tit
Tight pussy to make me cum quick
Yo, dumb bitch (ah shit)

[Verse 2: 360]
We like to carve women, fat chicks with lard in 'em
And make 'em anorexic and jam my shaft in 'em
My last victim copped an arse kicking
Your heart sinkin', plus my fart stinkin' like Bart Simpson
Since my last chick, I've been in a foul mood
Only happiness, I get [?] when my bowel moves
We shout crude words [?], check mate
You'll get raped like a cripple in a neck brace
I think I need a piss, so open your gob
You might as well stay down, I feel like a bog
You better stop, I've got the sore behind ya
With quick fingers, if you talk, I'll blind ya
My cock's known when it mauls vaginas
They compare it to the Great Wall of China
A psycho, and if you hate it, tempt me
I'll confess to the kidnappin' of Jaidyn Leskie
And he's sayin' ""Please grab a blade and neck me""
'Cause he's sick of bein' the ice in my favourite Esky
I'm a crazy MC, if you make a threat, g
Then I'll raise my leg and break your neck and make your chest bleed
Don't hate, I'm friendly, the school dropout
I just followed the crowd, it seemed like a cool cop-out
I'd rather be fuckin' a slut groupie
Muff bruising, my boys watch me fuckin' her plump booty
Fuckin' her up, fuming, check it
And after I'm done rooting I'll cum in her mum crudely
So fuck uni, it's all right as a hobby
But you'll see me in a trench coat, hackin' her body
Your bitch might play 6, so kids might hate this
They'll have fucked thoughts of a midnight rapist
Me and PEZ are known when we fistfight gay kids
If you say a word, watch us flip like Matrix

[Chorus 2: 360 & PEZ]
I'm a fucking nutcase
I'll stab you to death
I'm inside your wardrobe
I'll chew off your legs

[Intro: 360]
Uh, yeah

[Pre-Verse: 360]
I feel 'em, I feel 'em, they trying to slow us down
We hear 'em, we hear 'em, but see we don't know how

[Verse 1: 360]
Now I'm seeing what I need to be
Running on through with a need for speed
One of the few with something to prove
And nothing to lose, so leave us be
If you feel like there's nothing to live for
Honestly, why the fuck would you live for?
That's the reason I give it all
But still feel the need to give a little more
Uh, now I feel like there's nothing more to say
Uh, I understand what I'm in it for
I know I could run this all the way
I won't get another chance if I miss it all
See if could have a crystal ball, I wouldn't
'Cause I like it when there's risk involved
It's the stuff, lights so rare
It's too fast, I don't care

[Hook: 360]
I know we just got started, baby, I don't care, woah
I know we just got started, baby, I don't care, woah, oh

[Pre-Verse: Pez]
I feel 'em, I feel 'em, they trying to slow us down
We hear 'em, we hear em but see we don't know how

[Verse 2: Pez]
See, we all need an outlet
But it seems it's a dream that most people ain't found yet
I knew it was out there, somehow from the outset
But believe me, it ain't easy picking a different route
It took a bit of living to figure out
Most keep on fitting in with the crowd
I don't fight it, there's no time to slow ride it
It'll all go by you, shit, life is too short to cruise forth
Gotta keep improving and move forward
Let the rest all happen in due course
Down there, I've been there before, don't want to be anymore
So hold steady while I walk this tightrope
I know I might fall but I don't care

[Hook: 360]
I know we just got started, baby I don't care... woah oh oh oh
I know we just got started, baby I don't care... woah ooh
Woah... oh oh!
Woah... oh oh!
Woah... oh oh!

And all the feminists sendin’ me death threats

Money isn’t somethin’ that you live for
Every time you want it just a little more
Spendin’ every dollar like it’s not enough
So watch you get rich and fall in the end, so

[Verse 1: 360]
Life is all about gettin' paid, make it all at that mental rate
Go and put the shit where your mouth is, showin' off your expensive taste
Ayy, livin' it up, not givin' a fuck, all you wantin' is a million bucks
Spendin' every little bit in a month and showin' you richer than us
Yep
Shinin', shinin' wow, how you buy that nicer house
Always spendin' that high amount, what you wearin' is hired now (woo)
Got you thinkin' that what you're makin' it'll buy the crown
What you spend it'll make you better than everyone in your entire town
Boy, you got mad loot, ain't nobody that is boss as you
You will never be the one without real ones so you go and get a squad tattoo
Look, where you shop at, yo, you drop stacks, and you pop tags, and you got cash
That Fendi that was not bad like, ""Where the fuck did you cop that?""
Like goddamn, these younger kids they've have gone mad
They see the way you livin', homie, they want that too (want that)
When you fuckin' grow they'll come to know that it's nothin' though, but it's funny, yo
You got a money phone 'cause their contacts as lost as you, you're gone

Spendin’ every dollar like it’s not enough
So watch you get rich and fall in the end, so

Why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)
So why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)

[Verse 2: 360]
Hustle, hustle everyday livin’ for that paper, boy
Sellin’ drugs and be your own boss so you ain’t employed
Money over bitches (what?), money over bitches (what?)
Are you really gonna go and tell me that it’s money over women? (oh)
I was the guy who was fine with it all, up in my mind I was dying for more
I took advice from the guys who had tried it before
(They took an L) Decided my life was designed to be more
The sky was my callin', I took it all, and we’re only alive for the tiniest portion
Acquired a fortune, livin’ it up, life—it was sorted
Buyin’ up all of society’s thoughts and make me a guy who was highly important
Life was so awesome, finally scorchin’, throwin’ around until five in the mornin’
Addicted to money and diamonds and thought it was all about that and the high of performin'
Kinda distorted, the title was awesome, decided to call it
Falling & Flying, but kind of ironic, ‘cause suddenly shifted from flying to fallin’
Funny how everyone think of the poor, thinkin' their life ain't worth livin' at all
Go and visit some kids in Nepal and see that the poorest are richest of all

[Chorus: Sydnee Carter]
Money isn’t somethin’ that you live for
Every time you want it just a little more
Spendin’ every dollar like it’s not enough
So watch you get rich and fall in the end, so

Why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)
So why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)

[Verse 1: 360]
Thinking back when it all was a dream
Coming up, being close friends with all these emcees
Looking at it now it ain’t what I thought it‘d be
There’s all this tension behind closed doors in this scene
In my opinion there’s room for us all to succeed
This ain’t a sport, why the fuck are we all forced to compete?
As a friend you’d never have a dude as loyal as me
I support them, why the fuck aren’t they supportive of me?
On the outside they’re proud of what I’ve gone to achieve
But deep down they’re praying I fail and fall in a heap
Is it ‘cause I’m in a position that they thought they should be?
Or because I didn’t conform and had the balls to be me?
When I see them on the weekend we pretend to be friends
The second that I leave them I get thrown in the deep end
The depth of it, it depends, what’s said from it, it depends
That just shows my strength is their weakness
Yo I feel like I kept my composure
My real friends, yo, we’ve never been closer
My fake ones act like everything’s kosher
‘Cause you keep your friends close and you enemies closer

[Hook: Robyn]
This will be my monument
I can say I did it all with love
Love, love
All with love
Love, love
All with love

[Verse 2: Infinite]
I guess I’m not your stereotype
I’m more that but me in your stereo type
I’m so driven; keep the sound on the stereo high
On the up and up, this never felt so right
All these vices though man, somebody’s testing me
But I ain’t stressing at all, it’s my destiny
This is my moment, do it for the love and I do it for necessity
They’re praying for the death of me
It's a celebration, we're trying to stay strong
I ain't getting rained on, I'mma make it rain don
Laugh at the people saying don't quit my day job
Never quit my daydream, live like it's my day off
Yeah I'm really trying to see it through
You'd be amazed to what happens when there's belief in you
I mean really, this is where I need to be
So I'm just doing what I need to do
It's like that, and I say

[Hook: Robyn]
This will be my monument
I can say I did it all with love
Love, love
All with love
Love, love
All with love

[Verse 3: Infinite]
Shooting for my dreams like a showdown
Lucid when I sleep, so real I can taste it
Time doesn't wait but we know now
So we can't be here to sit around and waste it
Shouts to my real friends and all my believers
Rid of all the snakes, I ain't sad that you're leavin'
No I ain't sad that you're leavin'
Hatin' on my dreams, funny they're the ones sleepin'

[Verse 3: 360]
We're all programmed to want what we don't have
And if we don't get it then we go mad
We spend our life searching, it's so sad
Imagine all the things we could change if we could go back
Let's take a journey into my soul
Break through the ice cold till eventually you find gold
Deep down still a kid but with high goals
Rapping ain't my whole life but it makes my life whole
Played the game, yeah, it's 'bout time again
In a scene full of fake cunts who act like your friend
They can't handle being second best
They'd probably cut your throat if it meant success
Remember that if they ever approach ya
Especially from anyone who's ever below ya
You never know their motives if they're getting to know ya
So keep your friends close but your enemies closer

Uh, I can't take this shit
Looking down on the earth and the way we live
How the fuck do these parents raise their kids
And what books are they educated with?
I went on my Facebook, I displayed a pic
Of me and my mates with different shades of skin
Came back ten minutes later then
A lot of the comments are on some racist shit
And I see that shit and it makes me sick
I don't believe in God
But yo I pray to him
They're my haters sins
I don't wanna have fans that are racist pigs
We're all humans
Earth is the place we live
That's how Australia is
'Fuck off we're full' yeah that statement lives
Yeah we are full, of all you racist dicks
Uneducated, basic shit
A topic I have very little patience with
And I shouldn't even say this
If I see a group of lads with a flag I bet you some are racist
It's cool to be loving where you come from
And it's cool to be patriotic
But real talk I'm seeing a lot of hate for Aussies 'cause
A lot of us are fucking racist cockheads
Yeah don't take me wrong
Most the time you saying something
You're unaware it's something you probably shouldn't say at all
All I'm trying to do is educate you more
That ain't the way we're supposed to exist
Now I'm on a planet where nobody lives
To try how Utopians think
Where we don't change the tone of our voice for the tone of your skin

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Even though I want you near me
I'm on a planet no one knows
So even though I've never been here
I've never felt so at home
Even though I want you near me
I'm on a planet no one knows
So even though I've never been here
I've never felt so at home

[Spoken: Joss Whedon (Sampled)]
“Equality is not a concept. It's not something we should be striving for. It's a necessity. Equality is like gravity. We need it to stand on this earth as men and women, and the misogyny that is in every culture is not a true part of the human condition. It is life out of balance, and that imbalance is sucking something out of the soul of every man and woman who's confronted with it. We need equality. Kinda now.”

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Even though I want you near me
I'm on a planet no one knows
So even though I've never been here
I've never felt so at home
Even though I want you near me
I'm on a planet no one knows
So even though I've never been here
I've never felt so at home

[Intro: 360]
Ha-a-a-a-a-ah
Yeah yo, yeah
Sort of a song about sort of booty calls and shit
(Yo, yeah) Check it out, yo

[Verse 1: 360]
Hey yo, it's times like this when you really need to choose a song
To tell a girl the perfect way that you're moving on
I know it's harsh but you're doing nothing for me
And we were just helping each other out when we were horny (Yep) Don't get me wrong, yo, I really do respect women
But that don't mean that I don't wanna have sex with 'em
You broke the rules though, we had an agreement
From the start we agreed no attachments were needed (Come on)
But I'm the one that's stupid for the fact I believed it
I was about sex, and your attraction was deeper though
We wanted sex though with no strings attached
And you say you love me, what kind of no strings is that?
Yo, I think you're really cool and you know you're mad fine
But to fall in love, yo, I think you picked a bad time (You did)
And the fact that you weren't down for whatever
I know it's pretty harsh but I've found someone better
Damn, yeah

[Chorus: Jill Scott (Sampled) & 360]
I've got someone better at home
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah {Laughs} Hey, hey
It's the breaks, I got someone better at home
Get over it, get over it, alright

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, it's times like this when I really need to choose a song
To get me by when it's time for me to move along (What?)
She's bored, now she's doing nothing for me
""We were just helping each other out when we were horny""
Now have a look at what I've gone and done did
This time I'm the one who falls for dumb shit (So stupid)
We wanted sex though with no strings attached
And I said I love you, wish I could go bring it back but (I can't)
I couldn't help it, the shit was so wonderful
Never thought that it would be me to be the one to fall (Uh)
I think you're cool and I love it that you're mad fine
To fall in love though, I think I picked a bad time (Yep)
I love every minute landing together
The sex is so good I thought I'd found my forever (Nup)
Relationships, I was done for whatever
And then she went and told me that she found someone better

[Chorus: Jill Scott (Sampled) & 360]
Told me that I (Damn, fucking hell)
I got something better at home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Feel so stupid
How could I let that happen, you know?
I got something better at home
Like, I thought I was on top of my shit, but I obviously wasn't
Alright, here we go again

[Verse 3: 360]
Yo, it's times like this when you really need to choose a song
To warn everybody not to get too involved (Yep)
If you help each other out when you're horny
As soon as that begins, that's the end of the story (Written off)
There's no such thing as ""no strings attached"" (Nah)
'Cause with no strings you're gonna see the whole thing collapse
(Fall flat) And you're thinking they were down for whatever
Be warned 'cause they probably gone and found someone better

[Chorus]
Okay, all right (Yeah, yeah, goddamn)
'Cause I know (Damn, uh)
'Cause I know, know, know
I know (You know it, you love her, wow)
I got something better at home
(Yeah, dude, I really like Jilly, Jill Scott)
I know (Jilly)
(Jilly from Philly) I got something better at home
(I don't even have to say that, you know I would)
{Ad-Libs} (Uh, I love that curvy shit)
(Yeah {Laughs})
All right, all right, all right (Jilly) Let's calm down
[?] (That's a pretty sick voice though, ayy?)
(Good stuff, Jilly Scott)

[Outro: 360]
I wake up in the morning and yeah
I wake up in the morning, yeah
I wake up in the morning, yeah
I wake up in the morning, yeah

[Ad-Libs: 360]
Uh, uh
Yeah
Yo
Yep, uh

[Verse 1: 360]
I was sent below, followin’ an endless road
Progression slow, but I’d rather that than never know
A lot of small things I feel I need to question though
And I know I’ll be better if I let ‘em go
I think back on which lesson to quote
But I can’t, can’t seem to remember the notes
And every second I hope to see a memory float
I’m in a bottomless pit so please send me a rope
I hate fakin’, the pain’s taking control
Try to tell the difference between my brain and my soul
To confront the emotions I feel
I hope and appeal to understand devotion is real to myself
Any odd pain, I turn and run
Every day I’m hopin' and prayin’ that my purpose comes
Will I make it in this earth as one?
Please be up front, ‘cause false hopes are worse than none, yeah

[Verse 2: Jeremedy]
I’ve got that ex-psyche ward type mind
Scribe rhymes on the type writes, tryna find a kind of finite
Answer, which is kinda like a phantom
Its presence can be felt but it can’t be physically fathomed
Shit, I've been to the maddest spaces in my imagination's atlas
Travelin' places for affirmation, a axis
But all I ever really found was understanding
Understanding that I could never quite understand it
I mean all of this, all of this in front of us
How could we ever try to comprehend the point of it?
Even if we figured it out, wouldn’t it be kinda spoilin’ it?
Then in the end we would really be missin’ the point of it
So I’m just avoidin’ it, you know, all these questions
I’ve been there, I’ve asked that, too much time invested in it
Guess my questions are in the form of raps and a beat
Not to figure it out for you, but to understand it for me

[Chorus: 360]
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand for me
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand for me
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand

[Verse 3: Jeremedy]
Take it back to the days when I wasn’t quite all there
Let you know where I got the ex-psyche ward stare
A time where my various personalities were all there
And they were all scared, yeah, a mind for the warfare
Found myself in a white room wearin’ all white robes
Never woulda been on this road if I'd have known
Spending all night alone, heavy crying and chokin'
Seemed like fire but [?] that I was smilin’ and copin'
But my soul was shut like, like Charlton Heston's heart
Now my head’s lookin’ like a big fuckin’ question mark
[?] so many times, I forget, where’s the start?
Your remedies pass full of the most dreadfulest scars
But it took an experience like that (Yeah) to understand
The fact that I’m alive is what I’ve come to thank
So if you need to question the truth, keep doing what you do (Yeah)
Not to figure it out for me, but to understand it for you

[Verse 4: 360]
Yo, I live in the present, feet embedded and I’m standin’ my ground
It might never be evident but, man, dammit, I’m proud
To stand in the clouds and show the world exactly what I’ve grown to be
Flaunt the inside of feelings that are known to me
I hope to see my mission's finished and refined
To the perfect expectations livin’ in this life
Innocence combined with an easily changed belief
Keep it the same and don’t just leave it as tainted dreams
There’s endless time for you to send a cry for help
But try and recognise and identify yourself
With substance, meaning and a purpose to grow
When you’re truly content, well then the curtains will close
And then it’s over, completed it’ll help you to fight
I can’t tell you the price for my value for life
I held on and strived to be a man, happy and attached with pride
Unearthin’ in the deepest me, then I’m satisfied
Huh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: 360]
(Understand the way)
I try and understand how it all works
I try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) Uh, uh
I try and understand how it all works
I try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) But we'll never know
I try and understand how it all works
I try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) So let it go

[Chorus: 360]
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand for me (Understand the way)
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand (Understand the way)
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand for me (Understand the way)
I don’t know why we walk this Earth

I feel hungry inside, I stay breathin’

But half the time, I don’t get a reply
So I end up havin’ sex with a fence (I had a splinter on that one)
And people say that I’m crazy
What would they know, what would they know?
I think it’s ‘cause I ate a mushroom
I found on the side of the road (Hi, my name is Bob)

[Chorus]
I feel hungry inside, I stay breathin’
But can’t feed, no wonder I can’t see things
Always suddenly snap for no reason

[Verse]
The most successful people I know have taken more than ten l's
They just kept fightin' while the rest fell
I know success well, but first I had to
Come to understand failure and use it as the best help
See, I learnt more from one time failing
Than all of my success combined, so don't stress now
When everything gettin' sent south
For the height you wanna end up, in time you will be sent down
You prefer how success felt, yes
Instead of cryin' a river it gets you ready to set sail
That's a story lots of men tell
I can't imagine what it's like for women knowin' that flesh helps
I ain't talkin' stem cells
Sex sells, if your chest is XL then you'll excel
If you demand respect
It doesn't matter if you dress well, what matters, where your head's held
Understand knowledge is the best wealth
Put trust in everything your common sense tells
And always give your best self
And no matter how it ends up you knowin' that you meant well
Get it together whenever you mess up
You'll be better than ever, you never been better
But see, the more belief you got the more better you get
Whenever you get in a beef go and dead it, whatever
See, the paper comes and goes, but a friend is forever
Understand time is money, go and spend it together (spend it together)
Chasing the stars, endeavour together
And get your team out the Matrix: Nebuchadnezzar
Keep walkin' a line, we walk on an edge
With no fear in our heart, we got a death wish
We on that next shit, they stay thinkin'
In that Blockbuster video mind, we on that Netflix
You're not defined by the dollars you're in debt with
Investments, all the celebrities on your guest list
The profession that you were blessed with
Friendships, or the many that you have sex with
Uh
Take away the money, fame and drugs
And check out how many exit and cherish the ones you're left with
That's why they call it friendship
'Cause one falling out could rock the boat enough and make the rest sink
What defines you is the hurdles that you're met with
The wounds you accumulate and how you go and mend it
You see a child's birth and how they cry and hurt
From this dyin' Earth and how we left it
I feel sorry for the next generation of kids
And the state of society that they're left with
'Cause we're literally slaves of the digital age
Instead of sayin' what we think we just text it
What kind of message is that sending?
Instead of stepping to our problems we're pretending
Instead of ownin' our mistakes we get defensive
We can't even talk these days without offending

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm looking in the mirror
Looking in the rearview
Watch should I admit to?
[?]

[Chorus]
Admit that I am evil
Admit that I'm deceitful
Admit that I am me
Admit that I am me

So listen to me, I know what you're destined to be
If you're messing with me, I'll leave your corpse dead in the sea
Seeing critics want addition but they never wish for it
Speaking [shit] behind my back and, even then, they whisper it
We're talking shit without proof, you lose another tooth
The honest truth, in the booth, I hit harder than Costure Zoo
These geeks on the internet scheme
[?] infinite, tell them to get fucked then hunt their modem internet
The joke's on you, wailing like your opinion was relevant
My damn meaning is adamant, you're just cynical and arrogant
I'm fuckin' annoyed with toys talking shit
Behind backs, so you void like promises delivered by Steve [?]
I've got the time for Cyclops [?]

I heard you're queer, not that there's anything wrong with that
But you hang around Peran and charge two bucks for [?]
You dirty rat, you're just a pussy cat on [?]
With Trials' styles, truly unique
Infallible (what?) I was just saying that I'm infallible
I don't bail at any game that I play
It's a game to me 'cause I came to Mel' to see the big lights
Get down and dirty like pig fights
Reignite to [?] any cunt who wants to battle
Me or [?] from the townist in Fremantle
Wood on your saddle, go fuck yours
'Cause I'm Hunter and I stay this coarse

[Verse 3: 360]
I smack cats while leavin' their tracks blind
They act phat when they just spittin' some wack lines
I jam-pack some anthrax makin' a van slide
If you act kind, I'll leave you with a flat line
I make lyrics to break spirits and take minutes
Out of their lives, sayin' how much I hate critics
Talkin' in the newspapers, tryin' to steer [?]
Their ballsacks about the size of my earlobes
Kiss my arse, suck my dick!
Stick your dick in a toilet because you're fucking shit
Look at these lame cockheads, these bloody name droppers
And they're just lame honest, I'm breakin' their frame on it
And if you step to me, you step to your idol
My lyrics state the [?] like celebrity titles
Showin' you cats, I've got the master, see
Name yourself one-eighty, you're only half of me

[Verse 4: Versa]
To get ahead of this scene, you're riding dicks like a saddle
These critics accuse me of using pre-writtens in battles
But they can't handle when I dispose the flows that are pitiful
With lyrics full of words that rhyme of an artist ain't shitted on
Knock 'em down like skittles if they refuse to back down
Dissing established artists when you haven't got a track down
A lot of people these days are writing the same dummies
Think you're an MC because you've seen 8 Mile?
All right, because I'm about expressing myself
If you're expecting the well, then here's my confession of doubt
Neglecting the crowd, wack even if you doping shit
These media critics only give us props when it's appropriate
Otherwise, it's lame to be teaching kids about violence
Aerosol artists using Krylon to [?] graffiti tyrants
After you're finished distinguishing, the crew has been diminished
I suggest you keep your distance 'cause I'm finished with these critics

[Verse 1: Eso]
Yo
Eso and 60
Yo you're fucking with wizards
So imagine my imagination running with scissors
In the kitchen, bitches
Cooking something explicit
Burning buddha man I'm cooler then a cunt in a blizzard
When I hold the mic I alter time
I'm cold as ice like Walter White
I rhyme like a typhoon
I shine like there's five moons
So ease back, relax and let the words fly
Off the paper major lazer's at my third eye
I can't control it, it's too hard to handle or hold it
It's real and still hungry
I feel like Filth Dunphy
See basically I got a head full of images
That can mind fuck the world with just this pen in my fingertips
And the oracle will only mess with your mind
I know the geo, Neo is just second in line
See this is what it looks like when you master your craft
And you can make the big bang look like a fart in the bath

Yo, yeah
A lot of rappers think they're actually dope
Move a few units then imagine the throne
It has to be known
It's true they get views on youtube
But I kill them in the number game that matters the most
I was so broke I used to make the girls laugh
Now I got a mansion with a first class bird bath
Wanted to go worldwide but they can't understand my damn accent
Like Brad Pitt in that snatch flick
Imagine the success that I aim to get
When in my eyes I still haven't made it yet
If we find a planet that's as crazy as us
We probably have a massive bender takin' alien drugs
That's the only time I'd put a needle straight in my blood
No pun intended but I reckon I'll be spacey as fuck
Take em back to earth get em wasted with us
And see if they can last a bender with Australian cunts

Hey yo six
I feel like I'm swingin' off fucking King Kong's balls
With a parachute open and a firecracker out my ass mate
Right now I feel like the most majestic centaur that has ever graced the planet
And jizz the colour of black and yellow so it looks like I'm shooting out bees cunt
I feel like a forty foot magician
Dressed in lions fur
Playing beethoven on a piano
With my motherfuckin' dick
If a unicorn had a platinum horn
That's what I would be motherfucker
With two dangling testicles running down

And my rainbow technicoloured coat is resistant to any of your ammunition

This is 60 in his element
Spitting bars that don't mean shit, they irrelevant
Fuck around and dis the whole scene for the hell of it
Maybe if I stop fucking around, I'ma celibate (get it, cunt!)
The only rapper with a perfect score
Yo, I've burnt so many bridges that I might as well burn some more
I'm the fake friend you see and then shake hands, make plans with you and cancel before the day ends (ah, forgot I had plans, mate)
It's really hard to make sense
I try to cash a raincheck and still haven't been paid yet
I've been rapping in Pig Latin like adlays
So when I say your ash tray, I really mean you're trash, mate
I'ma make a verse, make it work
Your life's a joke like your date of birth is April first
Your girl keep coming back - boomerang
She 'bout that life, all she wanna do is bang
The only reason I shot for the stars I couldn't reach
The only reason I landed on earth I couldn't see
So having bad vision's a good look for me
'Cause if I wasn't half blind, here is where I wouldn't be

Okay, I'm back in my zone, your time's up, bitch
I'll give you a right hook with the hand that I write hooks with

If the spliff's lit, then I don't turn up
They should call you the scat man 'cause everything you spit is nonsense
They should call me the scat man 'cause I'm shitting on 'em
Come to the clashes on joke shit and still when they get roasted when I spin 'em like rotisserie chicken
I just bagged an ounce and I'm about to let the Kraken out, I swear
And I'm getting fucked up like I'm at my Grandma's house
The one and only, I'm the blueprint
I'm sick of these average rappers stepping on my toes scuffing my new kicks
I'm talking 'bout no one specific, but if the shoe fits
You still couldn't walk a mile in it, pussy, I do this

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Get out your memory hats
We're going back, uh, yeah
Get out them brain photos
Try and think back
It might be different to you but this is my old school
It's 360, with M-Phazes
Reminiscin' shit, check it out

[Verse 1]
Yo, with the video games, playin' GoldenEye on 64
I swear I coulda played that game till I was sixty-four
Or Double Dragon or maybe playin' Ninja
Turtles workin' the whole time on savin' Splinter
Young discos, it's funny when you have a dance
And not afraid to leave your house rockin' happy pants
Yo, I love to make my family proud
That's why I rock free dress days in hand-me-downs
And watchin' TV, hated A Country Practice
I chilled by myself watching Monkey Magic
Or maybe SuperTed, Eric the Bananaman
Rockin' down to Granny May's and checkin' out the lava lamps
""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", I was a Nirvana fan
Ridin' down to the milk bar in my pyjama pants
For Bubble-O Bills and a stack of Warheads
Or maybe meetin' with mates to throw a Vortex
And Transformers was classic with Optimus Prime
When Megatron killed him, yo, I honestly cried

[Refrain]
It's my old school, hell yeah, them times were good
If I could spend one week back in time I would

[Chorus]
I sit imaginin', if I had a time machine
So I could go back in time when ya life's a dream
The happiest days, remember the past
When you were young, remember how your energy lasts? (uh)

[Verse 2]
I was a fiend for the basketball, preachin' that I had a dream
Every month I'd buy a One on One magazine
Dreams of meetin' Michael Jordan in 3D
The closest I came was Come Fly With Me in Three-Peat
And with the hip-hop, it happened in grade six
Me and mates writin' down the credits from skate vids
Method Man to Smith and Wesson [?] the stages
My first hip-hop CD was 36 Chambers
And Michael Jackson, my definite best age
Obsessin' to press play and wreckin' cassette tapes, like
""Smooth Criminal"" and ""Thriller"" and ""Bad""
I watched his movie, I was glad I didn't live with his dad
And with any type of music you're forever learnin'
And a Midnight Oil fan, yo, my head would turn for Beds Are Burnin'
And when it come to Slim Shady I'm a real addict
Big L to Nas, 'cause Illmatic is still classic
Every item of clothing was bought at Kmart
But it'd always get ripped down at the skatepark

[Refrain]
It's my old school, hell yeah, them times were good
If I could spend one week back in time I would

[Chorus]
I sit imaginin', if I had a time machine
So I could go back in time when ya life's a dream
The happiest days, remember the past
When you were young, remember how your energy lasts?

[Outro]
Hahaha, yeah
That's my old school, it's 360

[Verse 1: 360]
My life, my life is like the craziest fantasy
So I got the urge to be escapin' reality
I write my best shit when I'm sayin' what's bad for me
So in my subconscious I'm praying for tragedy
On that real rap shit, yeah, I'm back on it
Some are thinking that I went and turned my back on it
I just hear a dope beat and then I rap on it
But what's being real to me is if I rap honest
Watched The Secret, got up on my goal shit
Last night stayin' up ticking off the whole list
If you honestly what you're wantin' to achieve
You will probably receive it gift wrapped
Uh, I started followin' my dreams
And I got a little cream when I saw I had a gift: rap
Grateful, can't believe I did that
And now I'm gatherin' everythin' I can give back

[Chorus (Sampled): Max McElligott]
Sleeping with my back to yours
Back to back, back to back, we're strung out
Sleeping with my back to yours
Don't walk away, don't walk away

[Verse 2: 360]
Now I gotta keep it goin': no endin'
And keep the ball rollin': momentum
They wanna bring us down but we won't let them
Fail is a little word that we don't mention
I feel like it's still not true
Put me next to BnE and them Hilltop dudes
But everythin' is me and I guess I'm bein' me
Now I found a winnin' syrup and I will not lose, no
Takin' aim while I scope the crown
It's only gettin' closer and I'm focused now
Got told by the suits I should tone it down
They can go and get fucked, they don't own me now
I hope this doesn't sound negative as hell
But we did on our own without anybody's help
Fuck censoring myself, 'cause me being me
Is a essence of my sales and a credit to myself

[Chorus (Sampled): Max McElligott]
Sleeping with my back to yours
Back to back, back to back, we're strung out
Sleeping with my back to yours
Don't walk away, don't walk away

[Interlude: 360]
{Chuckles} About six years ago I was an apprentice chippy, and, uh,  PEZ told me to quit and focus on rap, and my boss told me that I wouldn't be shit. Look at me now, dickhead

[Verse 3: 360]
Uh, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
Uh, I'd rather be fit and wired
Yeah, I'd rather be givin' time
To makin' an impact and leavin' these kids inspired
Now I'm someone they can look up to
If you're down, brother, know that you can look up too
If they gettin' in your way you can push on through
And if they tell you that you can't tell 'em, ""Good, fuck you""
Never thought as an innocent teen
That this'd be me, the shit that I breathe, but I love it now
Understand there's a difference between us
Livin' the dream and livin' in dreams, I am above the clouds

[Chorus (Sampled): Max McElligott]
Sleeping with my back to yours
Back to back, back to back, we're strung out
Sleeping with my back to yours
Don't walk away, don't walk away

[Chorus: Gotye (Sampled)]
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this (yeah, yo)

[Verse 1: 360]
Fuck I'm sick of this anxiety
Feel like my brain is a massive gang fighting me
It's the last thing I want but it's fast in
Feeling like this shit is taking over and I can't think
Honestly I'm on the brink of insanity
With no luck and no fuckin' grip on reality
I try to block it out but it's too hard to keep ignorin'
How can I when I don't know the reason for it
I wish I didn't have to react
This depression, yo, it has to be that, I'm having panic attacks
Doctors want to give me anti-depressants
But fuck that I know that it won't answer the questions
Yo I need some love, tried to see a shrink
But I fuckin' hate it, always feel like I'm being judged
To most people yo I know I'm not seeming fucked
I've got the best shield I'm knowing how to keep it up

[Chorus: Gotye (Sampled)]
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this (yeah)

[Verse 2: 4TH]
It's like I always live in the past tense
Think of the steps to here, quick to discard them
Always missing a mark and
Pickin' apart what I did and what I can't get
Best friendin' me to myself it seems
My energy's giving a selfish means
My self esteem's driven by my never content nature
I love the chase, never shelf the dream
No matter how unattainable it may be
'Cause even if I fall short, it's all forward, maybe
Till the devil that's on my shoulder
Tells me silver lining looks better a little golder
Damn, in the mirror like ""Look at yourself
Where's your head at? You're crooked as hell""
Got me reaching for that angel, in need of a halo
Instead, I'm right here, speakin' to a stranger

[Chorus (Extended): Gotye (Sampled)]
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect

[Verse 1: 360]
The only muscle that I'm working out is beating in my chest
So every time it bleeds , it is feeding me some strength
I swear that I'll wear it on my sleeve until I'm dead;
That I hold it in my hands, when I need a BPM
My closets full of skeletons I'm eager to forget
It’s time for them to leave, so I need to get them dressed
I try to ignore the demons in my head
I won't speak to them again
But at the same time, they keeping me in check
I'm grateful that I figured out the secret to success
Now any goal I’ve wanted, I’m believing I can get
If I keep my head clear while competing with the best
With my eyes on the target, then my feet will do the rest
Stay humble to my fans and the people that I've met
'Cause arrogant motherfuckers are easy to forget
And I'm thinking I should strive to be addicted to sobriety
And try to make the most of this gift that is inside of me

[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far
So I don’t go too far
So I don’t go too far

[Verse 2: PEZ]
Searching for some happiness and went got it
Feeling on the verge of having anything that I ever wanted
To be honest, it’s weird cause when you living in a life
That’s so surreal and sometimes it’s hard to know who's real, for real. Still
It’s my life I’m not giving it away
I’m sure these people hanging around who I can’t trust, but fuck it, Let's toast of success
Celebrate it;  couple more fucking faded
I could stay here all night hoping to get a little bit more high
Off a payment that all came
From having a bit of foresight
And I’m just trying to make my way through all that ego
Haters taking shots, you stave them off and then they reload
No point trippin’ off of people that I never met
Finally realising that this life I got is Heaven sent
With opportunities a lot of people never get
It’s gone by so fast and I'm just trying to keep a level head
Yeah

[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far
So I don’t go too far
So I don’t go too far

[Intro: PEZ]
Uh
Forthwrite
Antiheroes, check it

[Verse 1: Lee Scott]
I may talk like my brain’s warped
But I could step at any session and end it with a [?]
This ain't no game, sport, and if it is
We're not playin' on the same court, I said with no heart
I could make war with Bogart so don’t start
Ho, I stay spaced, when your show starts
I throw darts at your game face, yo
My mind’s a plain waste, I’m too hungry to say grace
Keep your prayers for passion meals, I eat scraps
Beneath the stairs in a cheap flat in Castlefields
Don’t even speak back, I plan to steal
Everything, from your tracky to the medicine in this baggie
Harass me, now the cyanide in your brandy
You call me a bastard and I reply with “Exactly”
The formula of a nasty accident
Awaitin' to happen and I’m laughin', embracin' it
The look on my fuckin' face is sick, whatever’s comin'
I’m awaitin' it, no pressure’s runnin' through my brain and shit
I mainly sit and chill, spittin' ill rhymes
Bars upon bars about how ill his rhymes are
And I charge for ‘em now, for each verse I want a car and a house
And I ain’t sold shit, Antiheroes
Broke kids with platinum egos
I roll thick when alone, stoned with a whole clip in [?]

[Verse 2: Salar]
When I die I hope you go to hell and get rejected
Get thrown in an AIDS infected, waste collected, place scented
With blood, get your face cemented, then crushed and ended
With a hammer till it's asymmetric
How's that for a crazy head trip? It's hectic
Six million ways to die, to you I hope they're all implemented
Six million states of mind all interconnected
In my brain, all mixed and causin' stresses
And the result is this raw war message
You'll all get hit or develop a gore fetish
Meant to be physically tested
Given crude oil, I'm forced to neck it, nuttin' more expected
Yo, check it, the flow is perfected
Every punchline [?] is deflected, directed
Straight back at the source's first exit
It's like a slap to the jaw, I stay quiet
Till heads start feelin' cocky and begin askin' for war
So stop frontin' 'cause we sense the pre-tense
You ain't bad, you was probably one of the prefects
What happened? You used to be on it, you reject
Do you smoke too much green? (Yes) You losin' sight
[?] dream, six points, you still ain't writin' the theme
Now, I ain't tryna impress (uh)
Just because my mother knows a little something like I am the best

[Verse 3: 360]
Yeah, and when I write, I put the knife in your pegs
My rhyme book's a tattoo 'cause it's inscribed in your chest
Fuck '60, I'll change my name to Kylie or Jess
Because I roll around Melbourne on a bike in a dress
The definition of a sellout, livin' life for the cheques
I'll only write rhymes till I'm rich and drivin' a Lex'
I'm crazy, I'll drive it up and down the side of a fence
While wearin' diamonds with PEZ and wavin' hi to my friends (hi!)

[Verse 4: PEZ]
And I'm the kind to always lie in my bed
Throwin' slices of bread, cryin' and say ""why aren't I fed?""
And I'm nice despite live there's only mics in my set
My DJ said ""bye"" and he left because I'd fight with his decks
Yep, I find that life is why inside, I'm upset
I'm excited by death, for me suicide is like sex
But it's kind of a mess, I'm tryna find a new quest
I'm only rappin' this because it felt like time to confess

[Verse 5: 360]
Yeah
Hey, you got no idea what's goin' on inside of my head
Nah, nah, really, I mean what's on inside of my dreads
With all types of insects who always try to infest
And different spiders in webs, they're all combined at the legs
I've been an alcoholic since the first time I was blessed
Baptised by a keg, buy a pint of Piney or Beck's
And Mum didn't help, because inside of her chest
She didn't have milk, I was drinking wine from her breasts

[Verse 6: PEZ & 360]
Was it a white or a red? Hold on, I'll slice 'em and check
Oi Mum, come and meet me now outside on the steps!
""Why?"" 'Cause I said! ""Have you had your vitamins?"" Yes!
Shut the fuck up '60 before I bite off your leg
And you're only left with your right 'cause your other side is a peg
And you have to hobble your arse around, look like a pirate with dreads (fuck off AIDS)
What? I haven't got AIDS, I made 'em lie on the test
Now, I can live in denial with hepatitis instead (yes)

[Verse 7: PEZ]
It sounds good but I'm still kind of depressed
It's combined from the test and tryna win the title in chess
And I'm stressed, lookin' like I'm Frankenstein in a vest
Gotta try to get dressed with this fuckin' pipe in my neck
Uh, think you can kill me, take my life in a sec?
Well, you're wrong, I'm too good, I won't even die when I'm dead
My rhymes are the best, look, see my mind in effect
Nah, really you can, I'm missin' the eyes in my head
I'm fine now but there was nine straight nights where I bled
But I guess that's what you get for havin' lions as pets
Were they tigers? I forget (ha ha)

My author was R.L. Stine
Ch-ch-choose your own adventure
Dig deep and remove it from the centre
Do what you were sent for, something that it was meant for
You, look where you can end up
And when it ends up, who will you remember?
Me, go and set the trend for
Anyone who’s met ya, you will be the benchmark
We all on the starting five, you've secluded to the bench
Have a think, though, who are you to them?
Get ya arse up and remove it from the fence
My integrity says: “I can't get a job, never again
I do what I want and whenever I can
'Cause we only live once, in a second it ends”

[Verse 2]
There’s some new faces
We change the game but can you blame us?
All they care about is who’s famous
What true fame is, but fuck ‘em, game on
Who they kiddin'?
Fuck Facebook and new age critics
I'mma do it like Bruce Wayne did it
Get a new cape fitted ‘cause I do save innit
Is it gonna be a new age gimmick?
Is he gonna rap with 2 Chainz, eh-eh
How much can a dude make, millions
How do you think I bought a new plane, I did it
Now I really got a new place fitted
I ain’t stupid, I do save with it
Never gonna get it with a suitcase fitted
How you'll gonna know, though, if you ain’t in it?
Forget it, go and get prepared
Fuck fear, we ain’t never scared
I know what'll get us there
Like ""fuck it, we’re already there""

[Intro]
Ayy bro
Have you ever met that fucking Tommy Sixx cunt man?
That cunt's a fucking nutcase, ayy, I've seen-
I've seen the cunt full fly kick this fucking nanny right in her tits, mate
Mate, he's fucking mental repping FTP and shit
When it comes to fucking hectic cunts, he is the hectickest
(Yo put your motherfucking bitch up homie, you don't know who you're talking to)

[Hook]
Yippy yippy yai, yippy yo, yippy yay
FTP in the motherfucking place
And you know we got a death wish
Yo you better leave that cunt alone I heard that dude's hectic

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you all a story 'bout a basic cunt
Never wanted to be shit but a crazy fuck
You might have seen him at the station once
You never met him but I guarantee you hate the cunt
Don't deserve him when he's taking drugs
He does the same shit Satan does, angel dust
And the street cred he got he just made it up
Middle fingers in the sky and they motherfucking staying up
Yo he got himself a bitch but he ain't in love
Never smokes all he raps about is blazing up
No car but he needs one
The type to see a speed bump then speed up
How many bodies? You'd love to know though
No Instagram but he loves a photo
FTP on his fucking logo
Whenever there's a camera, fuck the po-po
So hectic

[Hook]
Yippy yippy yai, yippy yo, yippy yay
FTP in the motherfucking place
And you know we got a death wish
Yo you better leave that cunt alone I heard that dude's hectic

[Verse 2]
No guns but he comes with a blade
I guarantee he spells ""cunt"" with a K
His crew verse you, you'll get punched in the face
But if you see him one on one, he'll be running away (leg it!)
If he's got a backpack, then he's come for a paint
Polo on and it's tucked in the front in the waist (throwies bruh!)
You should see his fucking rat's tail
I mean literally on his head he stapled a fucking rat's tail
I ain't saying he's on methadone
But I reckon it's either meth or don't so just let him go
Check the format, where's the porn at?
Spend a whole year stealing all his ex's broadband (check me out!)
Downloaded so much porn, got his broad bent
Now he hear the chick's the lead singer of a broad band, (oh god cunt)
His crew look ready for war, but to us they look ready for sports
So fucking hekkas

[Hook]
Yippy yippy yai, yippy yo, yippy yay
FTP in the motherfucking place
And you know we got a death wish
Yo you better leave that cunt alone I heard that dude's hectic

[Verse 3]
Listen
I'm kind of thinking that you should let him be
You fucked up though when you befriended him
'Cause he'll be the best man and he'll lose the wedding ring
And you'll find him trying to hock it in the queue for Centrelink
(You want a ring mate?) Grabs pics with his crew and everything
Face covered, homie, you ain't proving anything (throwies bruh!)
He ain't new to medicine but he brews amphetamines
No suit though but he's got the pseudoephedrine (any fucking pseudo)
And promethazine while he's chewing mescaline
Too incredible on a level that you will never be
Pick a fight like you offended him
The adrenaline in his head's a boost of energy
So fried that he'll lose his memory
So cooked he gotta Google everything like ""who just messaged me?""
""Oi, cunt! Was that you who texted me?""
Two phones he got a new one every week
Yo he's fed up with his bitches, he's never got a missus
Everybody gets attached, human centipede
If you see him do crime, though, you should never speak
He's on the run without doing anything
He's the hectickest

[Hook]
Yippy yippy yai, yippy yo, yippy yay
FTP in the motherfucking place
And you know we got a death wish
Yo you better leave that cunt alone I heard that dude's hectic

[Outro]
Aw, man, things have just been fucked, ayy, like; My fucking, my missus cheated on me with my best mate. She did that on my fucking birthday. My fucking-
The rims  on my VL got fully jacked last week and it's been fucked, the tires have been fucked, I can't even drive the cunt around, can't do anything like that, the fucking-
They've frozen my Centrelink payments. They're not going to give me a payment until I fucking- until I give them- give them a medi- medical certificate, or something like that
It's just fucked man, it's just like, it's just sometimes I just, I don't want to go on anymore, you know what I mean? Like I just can't fucking do it any more. But-
You reckon you could spot me a tenner?Cheers cunt

We ain't stopping till six in the morning
Fuck that we ain't stopping till our chins hit the floor and

We'll meet you in Beverly Hills, we already paid for the medical bill, for real
And still we running from cop cars
This paranoia from never working this job's harsh
We spend our days just living like we rock stars
I guess in every way we are without the rock part

Where did it all go wrong
Where did it all go wrong

Then I got myself airborne
Felt the rush of this new thing
The only thing that I cared for
Would've never of guessed it
So strong I don't get affected
Doesn't matter if you never get it
Levels ahead, but stay level headed
Spent years in the sky
Lucky that I'm here and alive
Cause' that come down when you touch down
You fear for your life
Hadda really decide
Get on course and then steer to the light
In the sky for so long
It'll make it a little unclear in your mind

But now I am a new me
And now i know that's what I needed
I don't want to ramble on
But I let go of everything
That I never had a handle on
Check the cloud that I landed on
What the hell are you waiting for?
Tell me something you're praying for
Say the things that you're grateful for
Feel it coming and wait for more

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Ain't no you and me, baby life goes on
Uuuu—uu—uuu—uuuu—uuu—uu—uu
Never speak again
Say goodbye, so long
Uuuu—uu—uuu—uuuu—uuu—uu—uu
You and I
You and I

[Post-Chorus/Ad-Libs: Styalz Fuego]

[Verse 3: 360]
Is it real or what?
Eyes closed, I feel the buzz
I'm knowin' where freedom's from
Mind open and clear as fuck
I was feeling stuck
Now I don't need no drug
Eyes closed so it doesn't matter
Life's shown me what really does
Never felt love like that
Now I'm sending the love right back
I hit rock bottom
Shake it off and just come right back
I ain't chasing the rush I had
Yo, I'm cool with the rush I have
All it took was a little bit of time
And a little bit of pain and just like that

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Ain't no you and me, baby life goes on
Uuuu—uu—uuu—uuuu—uuu—uu—uu
Never speak again
Say goodbye, so long
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I

[Verse 1: 360]
Hey yo, money makes the world go 'round, we know that
Is it gonna change your life if you own that?
Is it gonna have you high in the sky where you're so glad
Will it just define what you're known as?
While I'm wishing that I had a mint
I'd share it round if I had some riches
See with money though yo it can't bring us happiness
But it will bring the things we'd be happy with (indeed)
While the homeless are begging for some change
There are some who are begging for a change
You disagree, start begging for a change
We need change but everything's the same
I can't be another one running in a rat race
Living in a life where it's all about the cash mate
So forgive me, I'm a go and practice me
'Cause I feel like that's for me so...

[Hook: Josh Pyke]
I know that it goes on but we don't want to know that
I know that I've been wrong but I don't want to go back
So I throw it, throw it all away
I'll throw it, throw it all away

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo meet generation yes, we party so much
Got our folks worried that our hearts will blow up
It's funny that we can't say no but
I hope we don't hit it too hard and go nuts
Yo, we will know in time
Man this shit that kills us is why we all feel so alive
And get paid on Friday from working all week then
Forget it all by blowing it on the weekend
And some will say 60 is a fool
The kid's a beginner because he didn't finish school
Yo it wasn't for me mate
Working in the office on weekdays is not what I'll be mate
It ain't 'cause I'm broke that I'm wanting to seek change
I'm a treat this like my job and I'll see pay
So forgive me, maybe it's my lack of sleep
But I feel like I have to dream so

[Hook: Josh Pyke]
I know that it goes on but we don't wanna know that
I know that I've been wrong but I don't wanna go back
So I throw it, throw it all away
I'll throw it, throw it all away

[Bridge: 360]
Hey yo I can't be one of them dudes no more
I ain't gonna be wearing them shoes no more
Won't waste time all for the loot no more
With no idea what I can use it for
Yeah, yo I don't wanna work 'til I'm fifty
And then spent what I've earn't 'til I'm sixty
So forgive me, I know it's got a hold on me
But no way is it controlling me, no

[Hook: Josh Pyke]
I know that it goes on but we don't wanna know that
I know that I've been wrong but I don't wanna go back
So I throw it, throw it all away
I'll throw it, throw it all away
I know that it goes on but we don't wanna know that
I know that I've been wrong but I don't wanna go back
So I throw it, throw it all away
I'll throw it, throw it all away

[Intro]
I dunno what I want to change
But I know I shouldn't stay the same
I dunno what I want to do
And I dunno what I want from you
So I'm on my way
Looking for another one to get me through
It's my bad if I met with you and you left confused
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do
With you?

[Verse 1]
See you know the girl, yeah, you know the type
Yo, she doesn't know the world, but she knows a fight
She wants a boyfriend now, go and have a closer look
Talk about a bad choice like she wrote the book
She been talking to this guy for a while and he wants in
But he's a nice guy, so she don't want him
But why is it that the ones that are bad for you
Always seem to be the ones she's attracted to
Yo, it's the same shit, yo, you have to chill
You turn a small thing into a massive deal
See you don't have to care but
We have a good week and then it's back to square one
In this life that you lead most the time
You just fight with the weak then you cry as the cycle repeats
But you don't think it's a problem
I guess the first step is admitting you've got one

[Interlude]
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do
With you?

[Verse 2]
Yo, I don't know who you are, where'd you come from? (from)
Why you getting so mad, where's the love gone? (gone)
Why I feel like there's somethin' that I've done wrong? (wrong)
And why I feel like you're someone I should run from?
Hey, yo, it's endless
Listen to me, come on, I don't wanna punch on
I feel like I'm fighting myself with no gloves on
Why is it that the ones that are bad for me
Always seem to be the ones that are attracting me?
'Cause she love me, she love me
But why she always wanna fucking erupt me?
It's never me though, trust me, it must be you
'Cause you always turn nothin' into something
True, but you stay upset
Yo, I can't count each and every day I've left
I give it twenty-four hours till we break up next
But I guess it's all worth it for the make up sex

[Chorus (Condensed)]
I dunno what I want to change
But I know I shouldn't stay the same
And I dunno what I want to do
That ain't all though, I dunno what I want from you
So I'm on my way
Looking for another one to get me through
It's my bad if I met with you and you left confused
What the fuck am I meant to do?

[Verse 3]
Living in the sex and the drugs and the rock and roll
I'll admit it, though, I lost control
I met a girl with a positive soul
She regretted that she ever went and got involved
Couldn't handle all the people talking
I let 'em keep going and I keep ignoring
I'm past those days always keeping score
And I said it and I meant it, that ain't me no more
They see the lights and it's seeming exciting
But see as time goes by it is blinding
But see I really, really want to meet wifey
But the way that I'm living ain't likely
Yeah, being a rapper ain't getting me far
I don't have a house or a pet or a car
I'm twenty-four living in my parents' garage
Safe to say that I'm off to a terrible start

[Chorus]
I dunno what I want to change
But I know I shouldn't stay the same
And I dunno what I want to do
That ain't all though, I dunno what I want from you
So I'm on my way
Looking for another one to get me through
It's my bad if I met with you and you left confused
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do
With you?

[Outro]
I dunno what I want to change
But I know I shouldn't stay the same
I dunno what I want to do
And I dunno what I want from you
So I'm on my way
Looking for another one to get me through
It's my bad
What the fuck am I meant to do?

[Verse 1: 360]
Ayo
People need to know I got a weakness, I'm anxious
They think I should be happy 'cause they see that I'm famous
Weekends my favourite, see friends get wasted
Weekdays, I hate it, I'm insane and jaded
And yo, I'm feeling like I'm nearly dead
See now the glass is looking foggy I should probably go and clear my head
I know it's hard for people to understand it
But when it comes to alcohol, I ain't got no self control
I know it's something that you mightn't think
'Cause two quiet drinks is like a few minor sips now
I need more, I'm knowing that I shouldn't
But I keep going, now I'm getting better and I'm clean ya'll
Airin' out my bads is a stupid move
I could give a fuck, 60 is a human too
We've got problems even when your thoughts are hitting rock bottom
Most important thing for you's to not dodge it
It's not often that I try to give advice
So maybe just ignore it, it likely isn't right
So when I go ahead and write some shit like this
I'll be going through hell and it'll fix my shit
I just really felt the urge to let you inside 6
So know I'll never reach the point where I slit my wrist
Anyone who's high yo', you have to be landing
When you come down this can be your National Anthem, yeah

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey (Sampled)]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Booyah baby, bow down, making me so wow now
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Verse 2: 360]
Uh
It probably ain't the right environment to make it known
But the closest person in my life tried to take their own
Now my girlfriend is going through the same shit
And she knows exactly how I'm feeling, the same shit
It's fucked she had two friends hang themselves
To understand what she's going through, imagine hell
It's such a shame those girls who were leaving this life
Could never really know the pain they were leaving behind
And now I can see in her eyes that she is bleeding inside
So when I start to get down I just keep it in mind
It's fucked that we related, so dope
But after all the tragedy it made us so close
That's what I mean when there's positives in negatives
Even in a tragedy there's positives in everything
I must be crazy, I could be out fucking groupies
But that's meaningless, that life means nothing to me
Yeah, I could fuck that slut
But yo' I've lived that life and I've done that stuff
And to be with somebody that I love that much
There is no chance in hell that I would fuck that up, no
She's like my medicine for actual pain
When I'm not around her I go back to insane
So, I'm praying everyday that that happiness stays
And she can make Colwell her family name, please

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey (Sampled)]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Booyah baby, bow down, making me so wow now
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Uh
I'm mentionin' names, someone will be coppin' some flak
And, like Debris' arsehole, I will be coppin' some Flak (ha ha)
You're honestly wack, you about to get smacked mate
To top it off, he's AKA, he's fuckin' Fat Face
And put the mic in the sack
You sound like a fifty-year-old bikie trying to rap (yeah, yeah)
Enough of that shit, let's see who's next
A fuckin' retard who calls himself Fubex (faggot)
Anymore and I'm smackin' this feather
Someone tell this cunt to go back to Eurella
No matter how hard you try, you're pitiful g
When I say you're spittin' to me, I mean it literally
I grab both my hands for this crew 2Up
And pick two fingers because your fuckin' crew sucks
Talkin' about how you hate corners
When you dress and look like some reject bloody skateboarders
And now I'm dissin' you cats
Let me bring out this dickhead who's thinking he's black
And I'm about to let you know about a thug rapper
I'm talkin' 'bout this Judge fella, he's a fuckin' grudge [?]
You see your face in the news [?]
That's too bad, white kids ain't supposed to wear Doorags
When you rhyme, you should cover your mouth you slob
You wanna-be-50 Cent, jockin' how to rob

[Verse 2]
Now I'm dissin' these dudes, Suffa and Pressure and shit
The Hilltop Hoods, they can suck and just press on my dick
These guys suck cock, they named their album The Calling
Because they're getting called to fuck off
And I've got the better style
Reason loves his job at teaching because he's a fuckin' peadophile
This dude thinks he raps original
I know for a fact he told dudes he was aboriginal
I'm not being racist so listen through
He's not aboriginal, his fuckin' kid's a Jew
You're dead kid, you better believe it bitch
I'll leave you headless just like your penis is
Yeah, I diss this maggot, he's gonna get flopped away
Don't cry pussy, go to a fuckin' mosque and pray
Stop sooking you little bitch
And maybe you could get Little Mick to touch your little dick
I'm talkin' about Unknown, you little whore kid
You know that faggot you get to sing your chorus?
You thought no one would ever rebel
But your music video was just pathetic as hell
And you're a nerd, just listen
I use words of wisdom while you practice the art of circumcision
And you'll forever be shit
And maybe quit rapping and stick to sucking Pegasus' dick

[Verse 1: 360]
Religion in society’s what I'm getting inspired from
My head is saying write this song, but be prepared, it might be long
It'll take seconds to get the type of clock or kind of watch with a timer on
It doesn't matter; it's still a fucking timeless song
Is there life beyond? Or is science wrong?
Fuck what the Bible wants; I'm knowing what's right and wrong
I’m like the God's son went ahead and died for us
We just need to find a cross, the same type that Christ was on
And I'll get on; so only one life is lost
I will sacrifice the lot and only want a kind response
So don't worship me, go and get a hearse for me
Don't write a verse for me, just saying out the words I speak
'Cause personally, I see they burnt Jesus to the third degree
I got the idea, you twist what I say and bring out the worst in me
Plus the hearse is the only time you'll dig up dirt on me
And that's the end so close the motherfucking curtains, please

[Hook: Daniel Johns]
It's all about to end; it's all about to end
Or we could start it up again
But it's all about to end, all about to end

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah, it's so repetitive; you need to stop the negatives
From entering our heads again, it enters in, just exit it (All about to end)
How long you gonna be consumed with this pathetic shit?
Heaven won't let ‘em in ‘cause of what their sexual preference is
I ain't perfect, I ain't sayin' I'm heaven sent
The first thing they need to change is that fucking judgmental shit
Hear what I'm sayin' and don't be taking offence to this
You obviously don't see the positivity in these messages
They've already had like two fucking testaments
They need a third one now; I wonder what the new message is
We believe it's like a presence with no evidence
Looking at the sky with no real knowledge of where our heaven is
They're really more concerned with debt and where their credit lives
And benefits, you wanna be an angel? Go and get some wings
‘Cause humans made up angels, they made up everything
We made up Christmas, different religions, we made up wedding rings
So don't censor it, try and make some sense of it
Jesus knows you’ve got cash, can he go and spend a bit?
And pay big dollars for your God to go repent your sins
L. Ron Hubbard wants to buy some expensive shit
If Christ is asking you for money, that's offensive shit
I didn't know they had any currency up where heaven is
And there's a devilish smile on my devil's lips
The exorcist, takin' every kid and giving sense to them

[Pre-Hook: Daniel Johns]
Too many wars won, but something that needs gone
Simply together, speaking the lie, speak of a better time
Oh, there were too many lives lost, but something we need's gone
We're living the lie, always together now, sing together now

[Hook: Daniel Johns]
It's all about to end; it's all about to end
Or we could start it up again
But it's all about to end, all about to end

[Verse 3: 360]
I understand if they wanted to go all make believe
But God didn't write the Bible, it is make believe
They going to hell, they caught the gay disease
Take your ego out, 'cause every one of 'em is the same as me
You need a change some things, change the way your brain perceives
How other people live their life, whatever person they’re made to be
I'm seeing everything that Satan’s seen
And that still doesn't come close to when he faces me
It's getting cold so rapidly yo my brain will freeze
Put your hands together, I don't mean clap, pray for me
I see these motherfuckers chasin' me, chasin' me
I'll be waiting at the end patiently, patiently
Dig deep to the soul to know a human's worth
God is really a metaphor for the universe
Why hate homosexuals? What? They're too absurd?
Why abuse someone's choices when they weren't there to choose them first?
This is too superb, which life do you prefer?
Lucifer? Why's the sky the limit when the moon was first?
When your time's up, will you still believe in your faith?
Believe what you want, he works in mysterious ways

[Pre-Hook: Daniel Johns]
Too many wars won, but something that needs gone
Simply together, speaking the lie, speak of a better time
Oh, there were too many lives lost, but something we need's gone
We're living the lie, always together now, sing together now

Looking at an angel with a devil in her ear
Saying four letter words
That are making her turn, to everything she fears
Follow them and they'll clear whatever's in her head
As it burns, it gets worse
It's a curse and she'll turn, depression will appear

[Refrain: 360]
The snow falls for so long, you're frozen
Hold on, the cold war will be over
O—oo—o—oo—ah

[Pre-Chorus: Kiara Fox]
Forced her halo away for a way to escape
But inside is an angel in hiding
Locked away more mistakes are made by the chase
Caught up by the chance to get higher now

[Chorus: Kiara Fox]
Spiral down, spiral down
With a clipped wing
Spiral down, spiral down
With a clipped wing

[Verse 2: 360]
Lookin' at an angel with a devil in her ear
Now the roles are reversed, and she's breaking a curse
She's nearly in the clear
Fly away from anyone telling you to steer
To the person you were, cause without 'em you're perfect
Now heaven will appear

Why do we all have to find love?
Instead of just letting it find us?
I cannot tell if I'm blind drunk
Or live in a way that the sky does
I signed up
For that mind fuck that that high does
Wait for the day that that time's up
Cause I'm sick of just spending our time up
Feel like I'm loosing my head
Viewing the end, don't want a funeral yet
Cannot go through it again
Feel like I'm writing the plot of a beautiful death
And they say that, if you love somebody, set them free
So, even though this shit's hard to do, you gotta let me leave

[Pre-Chorus: Kiara Fox]
Forced her halo away for a way to escape
But inside is an angel in hiding
Locked away more mistakes are made by the chase
Caught up by the chance to get higher now

Let's do this, babe
Yo, yeah, uh

[Verse 1: 360]
They say the best rappers have died
So make way for the best rapper alive
And they hate, get sent back in a line
And some have come close, the rest haven't survived
I got it yo, it's my turn up in
Pay attention and you might learn something
360, I'm like Biggie Smalls
The difference is that I'm white, thin, and tall
Yo, I dominate locally
After that, yo, I'll dominate globally
I'll be patiently taking it overseas
And show the world ain't got nothing over me, nah
Yo, I'm looking for some heads to kill
Step to the 6, you can test your skill
Bring 'em all out, they get kicked in the mouth
And the king's in the house so the rest should kneel

[Chorus 1: MGMT]
Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel

Turn me on with your electric feel
All along the Eastern shore

Damn, '60 getting on his techno shit
Jumpin' aboard the electro ship
But the beat is impressive, how the fuck
He gonna get any love for this metro shit?
Since the song with Pez, no shit
With girls, I haven't heard the N.O. since
Heard some on that yes-no tip
Know they shouldn't but they wanna like ""Yes, no... shit!""
Hip-hop yes, yes, it'll change
For beats like this, I'm accepting the blame
Sent them away 'fore we left in a plane
Gettin' trapped in the sky while the rest will remain
I been doing it since Grade 5 dude
And to get here it takes time, true
Motherfucker, I done paid my dues
It's game time (Hey?), so they might lose

[Chorus 2: MGMT]
Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel

Turn me on with your electric feel
Do what you

Yo, to get where I'm at, yo, it took its time
Gotta keep going, never look behind
And I ain't thinking that I should be fine
'Cause I know that I will be, I'll go till it kills me
Keep looking up inside for the rescue
Understand that in time it will get you
Fuck the stars, I'm flying to Neptune
I'll get what I want, in my mind is the menu
Now I know that I'm finally there
While you're striving and fighting for guys to respect you
You can tell that it might be the year
And it's time, and it's rightfully mine, I can end you

[Outro: 360]
Yeah
Once I got told that the secret of being a ninja
Is just keep it real every time you're out, you know
Just make sure you keep your fuckin' feet out
Hahaha
See, the difference is that there's other ninjas
That think they can just bring you down whenever they want
But if you don't let 'em, then you're still a real ninja
You just stay true to your own ninja hood
That's how it goes
Keep that ninja, babe!

Ah, yeah
Uh, uh, yeah
Funk, soul and hip-hop
Ain't nothing else you need, yeah
Yeah, let's have a bit of fun
Yo, check this out, yeah

[Verse 1]
Ayo, there's no set method, just kick back and sit and vibe
Crank the drums and jam out and improvise
Intertwine while you're kickin' it and listen live
Empty, it's better, it's evident when it's simplified
Respect those that've passed away
Like Marvin Gaye or even Jam Master Jay
We get tricky with a sexual healing
Same atmosphere as a festival feeling
I'll get respect while I'm skillin' for the wealth
With my headphones 'round my neck, chillin' by myself
This ain't business, see I started vibe and jam
And stay different, me? I'd rather ride a tram
The young silhouette, singing away
Now with the image set, killin' a bass so I can give you a taste
And have you tappin' feet, movin' with some goosebumps
And make your spine tingle, groovin' to the smooth drums

[Chorus]
Da da da da da da da
Stay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'
Stay doin' the funky bedroom
The funky bedroom, the funky bedroom jammin'
Da da da da da da da (Hahaha, yeah)
Stay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'
We keep the soul bangin'
And keep the soul bangin' and keep the soul bangin' away

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I lead stop, live in the spotlight
And go to any measurement you know I want high
The melody raps, I'm tellin' these cats
Irrelevant facts and takin' all their elements back
Ha, the young dude that'll laugh a lot
It's sort of funny that it's hard to stop, man, I'm hard to top
I stay livin' in a life that's so care-free
But don't dare me ever to vote fairly
Never be broke, barely make enough to survive
And that don't bother me at all, I'm still lovin' this life
I still love what I write, havin' fun on the mic
I still make enough money for a son and a wife
You know I'm somethin' to find because I'm one of a kind
I kill that rhythm and tilt back the mission
For another day (yeah) I'm encouraging a noisy time
Take the breaks off people, and enjoy the ride

[Chorus]
Da da da da da da da
Stay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'
Stay doin' the funky bedroom
The funky bedroom, the funky bedroom jammin'
Da da da da da da da (Hahaha, yeah)
Stay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'
We keep the soul bangin'
And keep the soul bangin' and keep the soul bangin' away

I’m known to run and feel the beat before I'm overcome
I drown my thoughts with a method that's unknown
The golden child captivate with effortless dumb flows
The drums slow down, you feel the pop of the kick
Since forever hailed on the top of the list
Selected with an impressive list of impressionists
The future chosen, elected sittin’ with presidents
Never missin’ the penmanship, studyin’ a forum of groups
To discover what they afford to pursue (pursue that)
Designated, voted and nominated
The only obligation is to hold a conversation with a high form
Converse beliefs and never reverse your speech
Forever be firm and preach, while rememberin’ the night before
This life is yours but it's gonna a lonely one
But that's the great thing, accept it as the chosen one (chosen one)

[Outro]
Ah, yeah
Uh, now I'm the chosen one
Ah, yeah
And now the road's begun

[Hook: 360]
Been a while, let me go
Never gonna stop till I get a fucking crown or I'm set in stone
Haters better watch me, let 'em know
Better believe, he comes straight from the temple; Eddie Jones

[Verse 1: 360}
Yeah, sleeping on a fat yak
Unclean, yo I'm chillin' where the rats at
No shit dick, bigger than you've ever had
So damn big, you can't fit it in a back pack
Tried to post it on twitter though
Couldn't fit it in a hashtag
So I put it in a video
Better believe you couldn't fit it into snapchat
Put me first, never coming second no
I know that it's a long road, but I got a plane, any minute I'll be headed home
What happens now? Homie you will never know
Gonna receive it like a bad jester, so you gonna get beheaded though

[Hook: 360]
Been a while, let me go
Never gonna stop till I get a fucking crown or I'm set in stone
Haters better watch me, let 'em know
Better believe, he comes straight from the temple; Eddie Jones

Rolling 'round in my city

[Verse 2: 360]
(Fuck it) I barely have used my incredible bath
(Fuck it) whenever I want I can get in my spa
(Fuck it) The bitches all drop when my engine'll start
Glen Rice my sex drive, spend every night getting head in a car
(Fuck it) Tall; lanky, like Shawn Bradley, they fallen short
(Fuck it) They can't start me, I'm Dan Marjerle from quarter court
(Fuck it) A buffalo but I dunk so sick
Leave me the fuck alone, ‘cos you're Muggsy Bogues to Mutumbo bitch

[Hook: 360]
Been a while, let me go
Never gonna stop till I get a fucking crown or I'm set in stone
Haters better watch me, let 'em know
Better believe, he comes straight from the temple; Eddie Jones

[Verse 3: Miracle]
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who the illest of them all?
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who the illest of them all?
Rolling 'round in my city, still haven't paid my rego
Got your girlfriend with me and she'll do anything I say so
Huh, I'm the leader of the new wave
Gold chains I'ma new slave
Putting rappers in a new grave
Eddie Jones, I ball like a toopee
Better call the ambo
Black Rambo
Never out of ammo
Rocking camo
Two lowies in the van though
Takes two to tango
So I humped twice like a camel

[Hook: Miracle & 360]
Been a while, let me go
Never gonna stop till I get a fucking crown or I'm set in stone
Haters better watch me, let 'em know
Better believe, he comes straight from the temple; Eddie Jones

Rolling 'round in my city
Still haven't paid my rego (Eddie Jones)
Got your girlfriend with me

[Verse 1: 360]
You started having these migraines at a ripe age
Doctor gave you codeine just to ease a slight pain
Started crippling you by the age of fourteen
So the doctor decided to give you morphine
That was the first time you tasted what the high was like
Your brain was so fragile you weren't in your right mind
We never understood that when you used to have it
We were seeing the beginnings of a future addict
And that's an honest mistake the doctor had made
He only meant to help you in a positive way
And pointing fingers in this whole shit is not going change
That we all awoken a demon that was locked in a cage
I know the drug way of life is a lonely one
I hate that it went and attracted both of us
And opiates is so hard to overcome
Playing Russian roulette with a needle as a loaded gun

[Chorus: Chris Cheney]
Early warnings never come
Life is good when we were young
Just like the early morning sun
We will rise up
Life is good when we were young

[Verse 2: 360]
We didn't know you were getting bullied every day
Tortured, but wasn't strong enough to ever say
School is such a tender age it moulds you in every way
Forms in forever shapes your mental state
After copping more abuse from the friends you made
All you wanted was to get some fucking better mates
So when your head would ache, you just medicate
Now you found a better way to get away from any pain
So while you crying and lying in your bed awake
You know when the doc injects your veins it'll set you straight
We didn't know because you didn't have to ever chase
Saying you got a migraines would take you to a better place
Yo, this shit is going overboard
Too deep for me to help you stay afloat at all
All we've got left is hope so we hope for more
Because having false hope is better than not having hope at all

[Chorus: Chris Cheney]
Early warnings never come
Life is good when we were young
Just like the early morning sun
We will rise up
Life is good when we were young

[Verse 3: 360]
There's a day I can't wipe from my memory though
Like a episode of my life that I'm forgetting to close
He was done from life from ready to go
Ready to hang his head in shame but at the end of a rope
His addiction has ruined everything though
Pushed away all his family and friends that he knows
We could of helped but he was too ashamed to let us all know
We thought he found us annoying so we left him alone
For some reason Mum and Dad was sensing it though
Their instinct kicked in so they went to his home
He was trying to get clean so he went at it alone
So many downers he would of ended up dead on his own (yeah)
I got a call that made me burst into tears
I never heard my Dad cry and it hurt me to hear
Told him it was a blessing it could be worse than it is
Bring him home to those that love him for the person he is

[Chorus: Chris Cheney]
Early warnings never come
Life is good when we were young
Just like the early morning sun
We will rise up
Life is good when we were young

[Round 1: 360]
When I first met Rone, he was wearing a gay top hat
I said, ""First things first fuckhead...take off that""
On his iPhone, this faggot got a gay porn app
Your mate called Matt rang, he wants his baseball hat and his skateboard back
He's the type to crack at a DJ playing Akon tracks
Get in his face like, ""Motherfucker where's the Asop at?
You sound lame on tracks
I doubt that Grind Time are paying you
When I was back home doing drive-bys on kangaroos
This motherfucker was doing high 5's to skater dudes
The first song he made was, ""I'm Black With Pride""
The second song he made was called, ""In Fact I'm White""
He listens to Jurassic 5
Watches re-runs of Drake on Degrassi High
And puts his fists in the air and screams ""Rap's alive!""
You on some 120 shit bitch
You ain't even half of me
He's such a fucking pussy he makes Carter Deems look like Charlie Sheen
Time cunt!

[Round 1: Rone]
Yo, the bulk of the dirt that I got on your country
Was after watching 10 minutes of Crocodile Dundee
But Lush said I should get pumped for the occasion cause
You're like your country's smartest non Asian
Yo, it's a novelty still but with all of my skill
If you thinking I'm gon' say some dumb shit like Steve Irwin or Keith Urban...I probably will
Yo, so fuck if it's well written you gon' need well wishes
This is gon' get ugly as Mel Gibson's self image
Yo, I'll call your girl a beast with a yeast infection
You'll still call her ""Clementine""
You get her thighs, spread 'em wide, I bet it smell like Vegemite
You wanna go with the girl games well sucker let's spar
I got her phone number and hit the text hard
For my next charge, someone get Ken Starr
Send her a picture with my dick in my hand like Brett Favre
AND I'M AMERICAN AS SHIT!
I'm Honest Abe mixed with Johnny Wayne
Mixed with John McCain, mixed with John Mcclane
So fuck your standards for quality
Fuck your cultural oddities
Fuck your boomerangs, your Fosters, your koalas, your wallabies
I'm the coroners for foreigners
You're sewn up for Hell
So welcome to America...go fuck yourself

[Round 2: 360]
I can't believe that any of these dudes thought I'd never defeat you
You've got the build of a heroin needle
And the face of a lesbian eagle
So your best friend is a seagull
And you're acting all mean
Homie you're not clapping at fiends you fucking flapping them wings
I bet The Eagles are his favorite band
You vers' Kid Caustic look like two Emu's doing the mating dance
If I was there I'd stand up and be like, ""Fuck Rone""
Pulled out my boomerang and killed two birds with one stone
Yo, if I lived at his stupid house I'd crack his jaw
Because he keeps making rooster sounds everyday at the crack of dawn
I bet when he first heard of a team called the Atlanta Hawks
Is the only reason this faggot is a fan of sports
So I understand why you standing there looking all chirpy son
It ain't cause you're happy it's cause you look like a bird you cunt
And with that blue head standing there, acting like it's all good
But whenever you get angry motherfucker everyone gets awkward
Time

[Round 2: Rone]
Maybe cause I'm at my peak or your twisted family tree
They call you ""Uncle 60"" but you're looking like an aunt/ant to me
And I give a shit less if this bitch is 6'10""
Hands swinging across your face like Big Ben
Plus my gun talk dirty as a fucking pig pen
I hit a homer with your Barbie and let the Cal' rip Ken
If I had to get you, really grab a pistol, it's that Magnum issue
To blast a missile, with that long magazine like the fall fashion issue
Yo, but you got Internet goons that would ride in a millisec'
Cause you're the Internet nerd that made it out of the Internet
You even went Go Karting
Then went in an accident and got your scrotum ripped
I don't have a punchline I just thought America should know of this
Yo, it's not so smart to Go Kart but don't be startled
You're not going crazy, but you almost lost your marbles
So, you an action sports dork or yet it would seem
Letting off steam by yelling extreme
Mountain Dews, mounting dudes
Your bros got mohawks, think hardcore is an art form
Of fist pumps and sick jumps
Like rock climbing and hang gliding and zip lining and cliff diving
And aaaaahhh, a lot of this
A lot of that's going on

[Verse 3: 360]
Yo, your dress code is shit
You need some men's clothes that fit
You gay as fuck whenever you say a punchline you bend both your wrists
And I bet Rone gets pissed when people say he's metro or bitch
But what else can you say when you make Fresco and Twist look hetero as shit?
And on the net he says dumb shit
Like, ""I'm just hanging with a bunch of black friends""
But when you know him in real life you realize he doesn't have them
Faggot, you crew up in the country with your cousins and pets
And when you wanna go camping you just jump the back fence
Ayo, fuck Rone's life
Yo, this cunt's so white that his mom's Snow White
He's never been outdoors but he's had sunstroke twice
And he acts like he's black but fuck knows why
Bitch cracker, you probably get skin cancer from one strobe light
I can see your aura...I can feel it
It's white as fuck!
I'd tell him to get some thicker skin but it's literally impossible for this faggot to lighten up
Time cunt

[Round 3: Rone]
Honestly yo, 360 yo, your whole shit doesn't bother me
And I've been meaning to thank your accent for all the vagina it's gotten me
Shit, my friend's little sister even thinks that you're hot
That little bitch is a dyke though, addicted to twat!
Yo evolution is getting twisted so what kind of man is this?
Bitch you look like Ke$ha with Chelsea Handler's dick
So if I should be so lucky as to have myself a gringo
I'll raise my child right and have my baby eat your dingo
Lake monster, giraffe, motherfucking flamingo
You the vanilla Denzel I'm the vanilla Mandingo
Yo, and your junky's swags heavy with that wine house flavor
Making Caddy's behavior look like Tammy Faye Bakers
This skeezer never has a condom, but he always has an answer
Like, ""I've got a rubber band and a Milky Way wrapper""
Yo, with no letters, '60's finished minus his flimsy gimmicks
I think I see B.S./CBS like I'm watching 60 Minutes
So I'll go dininin on in a matter of 60 seconds
'Til your dinner is gone then I'll eat 60's seconds
Yo, I stay focused and blessed, I'll open your chest
And a flood hits your home while we hope for the best
Now your empathy lies with the homeless and dead
Cause you know what it's like to be in over your head

Yeah
Ah shit, '6, I'm back at it
But this time my bags [?] caps and acid
That's the best way to celebrate the fact
This is the last track and absolute smashed it
Fuck yes, I came for the fame
And the success, but I guess stayed for the dubstep
If it's making you upset, couldn't give a fuck less
Let 'em eat it up, '6, hit 'em with it

Pull my dick out like ""Hi hater""
Swingin' it around like a lightsaber
Yeah, my shit don't stink and my dick so big
When I lie down it looks like a skyscraper
(Look at that view) I'm retarded, dude
And if my son is then karma's true
Naked in the street yellin' ""Melbourne city!""
Finger in my arse tryna shelf a biccie

Damn right, we're back in the building
'60 and Bam Bam bad for the children
Black minivan, kidnappin' 'em all
We're givin' 'em alcohol till it actually kills 'em
I've had too many damn drugs
'6 said he quit, I'll get him to man up
Quick, somebody get him some damn nuts
'Cause I want him so drunk that he struggle to stand up

If Jesus is really gonna save us all
Tell me, what the fuck is he waiting for?

You wanna kill me but you never will though

[Intro]
This a verse I wrote about everything that's been goin' on since the album dropped
Yeah

[Verse]
A heads up, yo, my arm's gonna bleed
'Cause I'm about to wear my arm on my sleeve
I know that I'm a bit big but I'm 'bout to get a bit bigger
My Biggie poster got me looking at the big picture (damn)
So all I'm thinking 'bout is number one
I've done it once now I'm lucky that we doubled up
It's just begun, if the media ain't feeding us
It's up to us to make it, stop twiddling our fuckin' thumbs
So suck it up, it ain't doing it with bubblegum
It's beast mode, every day I'm workin', it becomin' one
I never wasn't one, I just became another one
The hunger that I'm feelin' has me feelin' like I just begun
Motherfucker, enough's enough
If they ain't with us then fuck 'em all, it's up to us
Get them hits up and I ain't talkin' uppercuts
They'll never see it comin' like a motherfuckin' sucker punch
Yo, I'm proud we topped the ARIA charts
We need to keep the ball rollin' though, it's hardly a start
Otherwise, it's like drive and bein' first in the race
Comin' out of the gates and suddenly parkin' the car
Yo, I'm tryna be the next king, a best livin'
But all I can hear is [?] Anne Smith or Ed Sheeran
It's got me questionin', but yo, I'm ropable
I can't make a post without 'em sayin' ""he's got meth in him""
I fuckin' hate they think I'm still usin'
I know they fishin' for replies but I still do it
And yo, it's not right, they thinkin' it's okay
'Cause I'm in the spotlight but, for fuck's sake, I'm still human
Yes, I was livin' in double life
The other side, I kept it under raps, it's been mummified
It's got me half-wishing that it was never publicised
I'm not a public guy, I struggle in the public eye
I know I'm trouble, I've said the shit a dozen times
Half of me is strugglin', the other half is lovin' life
Even though it's tough at times, I'm a lucky guy
To summarise yo, I'm thankful that I'm just alive
As far as attitudes, I get it from my mother's side
And my father was the who told me how to fuckin' cry
To tell the truth yo, it's fuckin time
I don't mean to undermine but, when it comes to levels, you are under mine

[Outro]

But I'm back now

We're both beings on this planet of Earth
Beautiful, beautiful on the inside and out
Oh, don't be sorry, don't be sorry, Dianne... you're quite in tune
But maybe there is one thing
Give me one of them rim jobs I've been hearing about
You just gotta twinkle your tongue around my star
Around my mudflap, around my entrance, virgin purity
I ain't gonna go down on your front bum
You're just gonna go down on my back hole

And then we'll call it even
Just make sure that your tongue moves in a circular motion

Downloadable mixtape for all the net-heads and shit it’s to sort of promote the album which is called What You See Is What You Get, which is out March 22, 2008 on Soul Mate Records (Cop that shit). Um, you’re gonna hear some unreleased exclusive shit that isn’t gonna come out anywhere else except here, so there’s a lot of old shit, there's this bit of newer shit and there’s some real heat in there. There's also two exclusive tracks off the album that you can’t hear anywhere else except for this. And um, if you go to my Myspace which is www.myspace.com/emcee360 , so that’s E.M.C.E.E.3.6.0., you can hear the two singles off the album, they’re up, streamable now, and you can watch a music video as well, and you can look at me, which is a fuckin’ privilege.

Uh, yo
Some people seem to think that we're arrogant
Well, you're right

[Verse 1: PEZ]
Shit, I rock ridiculous bling
I made this shit at home on my own with some glitter and string
Plus I rock Cheezels on all my fingers as rings
Stole a granny's wheelchair and got it fitted with rims
Then I got a sound system, hooked it to the seat
Now my walker has to push me to the beat (Do it)
Plus we're so famous I got my own stalker
I hate to speak, I've even got my own talker
Stunt doubles, I got three on pay
Fuck performing, this isn't even me on stage (nah)
I don't record either, shook by the choice
Sixty does the vocals and just puts on a voice (What? It's true)
So who's heard of that Xzibit guy?
I took a trolley to his house and told him, ""Pimp my ride""
If he didn't then my fists would fly
Mess his face up so bad even his fish would cry
To pick up girls, I just say that we're rappers
Ask 'em out to dinner then I take 'em to Maccas (Too cheap)
If the bitch complains then I'll flip raw dude
But it doesn't bother me 'cause then I get more food (Yes)
And fuck hip-hop, I only started rhyme
So I can go on Oz Idol and fuck Marcia Hines (That's it, bend over)
And half my lines, cats question aloud
'Cause I choose my worst rhymes and leave the best ones out (That's how we do)

[Interlude: 360 & PEZ]
Ah, PEZ, man
Ah, that-that's the chorus, dude
Are you gonna do a chorus, man? Ah, nah, man
Fuck a hook, all right

[Verse 2: 360]
Uh, it's Sixty Cent, the vocal bastard
Rockin' fake bling from your local market
Smokin' grass until we're chokin' hard
And I'll smile with gold teeth in my open casket
Always on the list for V.I.P.
And these stupid motherfuckers wanna see I.D.?
Bitch, everyone in here wants to be like me
Plus we don't pay to travel, 'cause we fly free
I never catch the train, babies reek
If I did I'd have my own allocated seats
In pinstriped suits, we dine in class
Our drinks make my [?] taste like wine from casks
And my butcher's got the nicest arse
I've got diamonds in my rings made from fibreglass
I need a shit, but I got tired arms
So I'll pay a motherfucker to wipe my arse
Yo, I'm tight with money, I may be Jewish
I don't like to talk, so I can save my fluids
Fuck Bec Cartwright in front of Lleyton Hewitt
And tell him Mark Philippoussis made me do it
I don't watch O.C. on a Tuesday night
I got the whole cast at my house to do the play live
Send the bitches to my mattress, hop on
Make 'em tell me that I'm rappin' hot songs
And fuck the faggots from Saturn dot com
I only fuck bitches with platinum condoms (ha ha)
So fuck off if I'm not arrogant
I'm so arrogant that I don't even have to rhyme

Watch that purple waterfall
Got me feelin' rich, so rich
Never go and poor it all

[Verse 1: 360]
Come see the cloud that I live in
I mean the couch that I sit in
I said I stopped but I didn't
It's another world that I been in, listen
When I'm on it I think I'm a king
Top of the world without doing a thing
When it's gone, I'm literally sinking
And I'm tryna look for a lizard with wings
Let me get some sleep
And some rest in peace
Got me scratching a lot
And my head is nodding without hip-hop beats
Eyes closed, where'd sight go?
I think time's going to waste
We're mind blown
I think mind's goin' to space

[Refrain: 360]
Time wasted, so wasted
Run away from me
But I'm jaded, no escapin'
The escape I need
Time wasted, so wasted
Run away from me
But I'm jaded, no escapin'
The escape I need

[Chorus: Daniel Johns]
My purple waterfall
Slow drip (slow drip)
I've said enough
And we see double now
Un-gripped
I've had enough

[Verse 2: 360]
Leanin', can't stay up
On one, that main buzz
Purple all of my paint brush
Found a way to make pain stop
Made up a nocturnal breed
Stay stuck in this perfect dream
I'm faded, but I
Wake up the second that the curtains bleed
And I'm slurring speech
Yo, I think I needa learn to speak
Been a while you ain't heard from me
But I stay, drown in that purple stream
Eyes lookin' like it hurts to read
And it burns to see
But if I lose spit, then just let me know
If my eyes close I deserve to sleep

[Chorus (Extended): Daniel Johns]
My purple waterfall
Slow drip (slow drip)
I've said enough
And we see double now
Un-gripped
I've had enough
My purple waterfall
Slow drip (slow drip)
I've said enough
And we see double now
Un-gripped
I've had enough

[Bridge: 360]
I'm feelin' wide awake, wide awake
I'm chasin' the dragon to hide the pain, hide the pain
Come see the cloud that I live in
I said I stopped, but I didn't

[Chorus (Extended): Daniel Johns]
My purple waterfall
Slow drip (slow drip)
I've said enough
And we see double now
Un-gripped
I've had enough
My purple waterfall
Slow drip (slow drip)
I've said enough
And we see double now
Un-gripped
I've had enough

[Verse 1: 360]
Straight out of the bottle shop, I'm just a hitman with one target
The worst killer in history, love carnage
You know when I'm around, it becomes darker
But it's worse when I'm not, 'cause it's much harder
You wouldn't even know when you run past me
Though many face God you won't unmask me
If you wanna know then just ask me
One minute a dumb bastard then suddenly I'm up market
You a masochist, no breaking jaws
You know it's gonna hurt but you take some more
How can you stop a killer who doesn't break the law?
Mind control, you can fight it but I'll make you poor
My spirit's gonna end up breakin' yours
There's no money but you wanna save some more
Every week though I'm gonna take it all, yeah

[Chorus: Savoi, Janeva, Reija Lee, Thief & Styalz Fuego]
'Cause no one loves me like the
Drugs used to, oo—
Oo—oo—oo, no—o—oh
Said no—o—oh
'Cause no one loves me like the
Drugs used to, oo—
Oo—oo—oo, no—o—oh
Said no—o—oh (said no—o—oh)

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, I'm here to take a spirit though I'm not a distiller
Got the right shots if you wanted a killer
Yo, I'm positive, I'm not an optimist
I'ma leave you more broken than my promises
Genie in a bottle with no wishes as all (wishes at all)
The only wish you get is you wishin' for more (woo)
Cheers and booze at the same time (same time)
Ayy, every victim I have made blind (made blind)
Ayy, sucker punch and you swallow it with guilt
Another cup then I promise it'll heal
Half-full, don't stop until it's filled, yeah

[Chorus: Savoi, Janeva, Reija Lee, Thief & Styalz Fuego]
'Cause no one loves me like the
Drugs used to, oo—
Oo—oo—oo, no—o—oh
Said no—o—oh
'Cause no one loves me like the
Drugs used to, oo—
Oo—oo—oo, no—o—oh
Said no—o—oh (said no—o—oh)

[Post-Chorus: 360 & [?]]
Shots in the morning, keep it going
Shots through the evening, stay lonely
Another day gone and we ain't notice
Oo—o—oo—oh yeah
Shots in the morning stay flowin'
Shots through the evening, chain-smoking
Another day gone and we ain't notice
Oo—o—oo—oh yeah

[Bridge: Reija Lee]
I give it up to find [?]
There was just too much to lose
Now there's a lot of fans of mine
That can love me just like you

[Verse 3: 360]
How many lives will I kill today?
A storm is brewin', bound to see people hurt
I pretend I'm gonna take your guilt away
But all I do is make it even worse
I'm everywhere from reflections of any wine glass
To the echoes of emptiness where you hide flasks
Destruction perfected into a fine art
Justice would kill me instead of sitting behind bars

[Outro: 360]
No one loves me like the
Drugs used to, oo—
Oo—oo—oo
Oo—oo—oo—oo—oo—oo
No one love me like the
Drugs used to
No one love me like the

They can hear me, they don't see me though
Nowadays on my UFO
In a league of my own
Don't tell me what they want
Don't say it's been my time (Ayy)
Right now I'm just living life (Ayy)
You know what I'm here to do (Yeah)
So I've got nuttin' to prove (Let's go)

[Verse 1: 360]
Fuck money (Why?) Poor, no (Oh)
Sex cells (Yeah?) Hormone (Ha)
Take off (What?) Your clothes (Yeah)
I got it down to a T (No wardrobe)
We came a long way from selling albums in the boot
Now we drop a song and see the shit has landed on the news
When you're makin' money watch what will family do 'cause
That's how you decide whoever's relative to you
If you rate this and feel this dog then make a playlist
Of the real 6 God and be the channel with the views
Money so high up but it fuckin' won't die
But if numbers don't lie then I'm tellin' 'em the truth
I""ll rock a purse, that crazy bitch
When I drop a verse, yo, a fat lady sings
I think my mum and dad should get back making kids
If I ain't the best born fuckin' Matt Damon is

[Chorus: Travy P (360)]
They can hear me, they don't see me though
Nowadays on my UFO
In a league of my own

You know what I'm here to do (You know what I'm hear to do)
So I've got nuttin' to prove

[Verse 2: 360]
Hey yo, I'm grimy, recording every verse up in a payphone
Do it by the book, but I'm skimming every page though
You'll be bored as until the time you see play though
Even as support act I'm still the fuckin' main show
I can find a silver lining every time it rains though
Grab the pot of gold while they lookin' at that rainbow
Ninety-five percent is the amount I'ma save though
The other five is fuck around money, call it Play-Doh
Why does everybody in this game rap the same?
I can put a fuckin' stop to this shit: Drake flow
Body all these unknown bitches: Jane Doe
When I say bitches I'm talkin' 'bout how many
Figures will I aim for, I can figure eight more
Grade me on the paper, boy, why you want that A4?
You ain't in the same league, let alone the same sport
You can't put a baseball player next to a racehorse

[Verse 3: Travy P]
Been a minute, now I'm back in it
Thought I was down, now I'm back winning
Thought I would lose, huh? Yeah
But I ain't no loser (Travy)
I ain't ever fell off
Always been a good fella, yeah
Veteran like De Niro
So now I stack hella zero's
Pent house on the top floor
I guess I ain't got no floors, dog
Girl, suck me like she jawless

Are you the type to keep it solid if the cops come?
If I ever get in drama would you not run?
I said a prayer for my lost one
Every time I did some time another lost gun
Are you that real, would you bop one?
Don't come around if you not one
I am too real to be short one
That's the outcome, where I'm from
Can't ride around without drums, yeah
I'm from the section where them drugs make your nose run
I'm from the sections where we smoke until it's no love

And a nigga found out where your mama live
We dropped your daughter off so she could babysit, that's crazy
Mmm, better watch your lady
Yeah, 'cause a nigga gang banging
Peter roll bangin', baby loc crip
You know you're gone, I can't baby no bitch
Play your role 'cause I'm tryna get rich
Get the dough, better get it out a trick, yeah

New chopper every show that I get
I could kill a nigga with the backend
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip, ayy ayy
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip, ayy
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend, ayy ayy

[Verse 2]
I'm just playin', I'm just playin' with my dollars
Fuck around and bought a Glock and a revolver
And I bought another chopper
Bought a draco just so I can stop you
When you pull up to my spot
I got a pistol when you pull up on the block
When I'm out of town, bet you get rocked
You don't know, I hit you with the red dot
I can even hit a nigga without
I'ma show a pussy nigga what I'm 'bout
You ain't never fought life one time
All a nigga thinkin' 'bout is doin' crime
It's over, that's how I feel
At times that's how I feel
It's over, that's how I feel
Sometimes that's how I feel
That's why I had to kill
You ain't felt how I feel

[Chorus]
New chopper every show that I get
I could kill a nigga with the backend
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip, ayy ayy
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip, ayy
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip

Please stop buggin' me baby
I be on the way to the paper
I got that blower on my hip like a pager
I'm on my tip, I might flip like a skater
Fuck around and sell a brick to your neighbor
I made my bitch serve shit like a waiter
I run my motherfuckin' city like the mayor
Hitstick with the grip, keep it player

Call me Greedy 'cause I came in with the flavor
Whip it, whip it like a slave, I'm a baker
House nigga in the kitchen with the white folks
I got high and start to think this was Jamaica
Smoke a nigga, send him off to meet his maker
Whole team wearin' purple like the Lakers
Lonzo the way I ball, step your game up
Gonzo, long nose make you wake up, chopper for the shake up
I was in the Bay, smokin' K with the gangsters
Crack in the streets, we from where the earthquakes was
Tell these pussy rappers stop playin', I'ma pull up
If they keep on buggin', nigga we don't have to play tough
We don't even play fair either, you can get sprayed up
I am not a sniper, but I'm quick to hold that K up
I got all this fuckin' dribble like a fuckin' lay-up
I'ma get the key and get some pussy then we lay up

I run my motherfuckin' city like the mayor
Hitstick with the grip, keep it player

[Verse 2: Yhung T.O.]
Please stop buggin' me baby
I'm off these drugs, my mind crazy
All this shit I been through is what made me
This Glock on my hip just for safety
I can't let these niggas faze me
I will not stop 'til I'm Jay-Z
Oh, and my wifey Beyoncé
We send your bitch on a blind date
I was in LA totin' straps with the gangsters
Ferragamo cuffs, used to be on the ankle
Free all of my niggas out the cell, give 'em anger
Smokin' all this dope 'til my chest feelin' strangled
I can't rewind with you
Wish I wouldn't've waste time with you
I got my love from my moms
But I got my pain from you
All the shit that you do

Please stop buggin' me baby

[Intro: 03 Greedo]
See you in your feelings, but I
See you in your feelings, but I

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you (Chang Chang)
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
I can see you in your feelings, I got twenty-twenty vision
I had funk with your brother, now that nigga never visit
I really think he scared of me, it might be the bear in me
A Northern California nigga, death to all my enemies
I got your text baby, but I ain't read it
It was too long and I'm conceited, plus you had too many reasons
For all the times I did you bad and ever made me sad
Your friends talk about me daily, tell 'em kiss my ass
You almost had me stressed out but I ain't mad at you
'Cause your new nigga gon' be broke, can't throw that bag at you
Bad Blac Chyna neck, shit weak, ball catcher
While I'm the type to buy the store and throw the mall at you
Chang Chang

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
I can't really handle your lil fingers in my face too much
You be in your feelings so that's why we always out of touch
I was in the hand to hand, you was in Fendis up
Feelin' like somebody 'cause you gave that lil pussy up
Thought you'd make me mad, huh? where did you get that from?
Really I was wondering who your mama and your dad was
They ain't teach you nothin' better, how to keep a man forever
Give me head and make me breakfast, bacons, eggs, and extra cheddar
I'ma need the money out these hoes in the morning (I need money at the door)
I'ma need the money out these hoes in the morning (I need money at the door)

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you

[Outro: 03 Greedo & Nef The Pharaoh]
I see you in your feelings, I can see you in your feelings
I can see you in your feelings, I can see you in your feelings
Your head I'ma kill it, I can feel it
I can see you in your feelings
Got your feet touchin' the ceiling
I can see why you would feel it
You won't see me in my feelings
You understand me, it's not me, that's the next man
You won't catch me in my feelings
Hah, you so
All I'm seeing is a million
Stacking money to the ceiling
We the rappers in the building
03, unlimited
Mmh, Chang Chang
We gettin' rich
Could you get up out your feelings bitch?

Fuckin' with the yacht, I blew a check on her
Told the homies she my bitch and I'ma keep it cool

While he missing all his kids, she's in bitches and dip
Politicking in the ghetto while his sis babysit
And she gon' give me respect, 'cause she know a nigga gangster

Dave-O, make me a slap

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I'm not the type to just sit in the house
Bitch, I'm the type to go figure it out
I'm not the type to type tough shit on Twitter

Just to sum up the difference
My OG told me that I had to lose just to gain
To sum up the difference
I'm something too different, to sum up the difference

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Ain't the type to talk shit, let you talk back
Bitch, I'm the type to leave a nigga where the chalk at
I ain't one to talk to the pigs, where my cell at?
Niggas never trapped interstate, where my jail at?
You ain't in the trenches, where the mil' at?
Nigga, you ain't scale that
Nigga, you ain't sell that
You just probably smelled that or hit that
Tell these pussy niggas get back
We don't do the parties or the kick-backs
Got beef, that's a big snack
Run up on me, leave a few stacks
I could drop ten, that's a fuckin' feature
Stomp a nigga out in these Raf sneakers

The check is mandatory, lil' whoadie be 'bout a comma (Uh)
Shout out Cinderella, go brazy in the Ramada (Yeah)
I had it hard, internally, nigga scarred
My gangland need me to fell the fellow in charge
We on our way to this war, please don't hop in the car
Bazooky in the jar, the foreign seats is velour
Double jointed the doors, I put points on the board
Makin' threats on the 'net, when you suckers gon' score?

I'm something too different, to sum up the difference (Uh-huh, look)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Niggas'll steal from you, tryna help you find it (Suckers)
Money on your head, the closest nigga lyin' (12)
Lil Ant was two years old when he felt designer (Swear to God)
Bitch pussy wore out, couldn't feel the lining (Bitch)
My niece mad, ain't no paintings of her in my house (Is that right?)
Me and her mama beefin', we ain't gon' hash it out (Uh-uh)
Pressed up a thousand CD's just to pass 'em out (Oh, I remember)
Niggas ain't want to buy 'em, now they cashin' out (It's Philthy)
Got my ass whooped every week because I didn't listen (I couldn't listen)
Kicked out of school, nigga couldn't pay attention (I couldn't pay attention)

Now I'm worth a few mil' to sum up the difference, It's Philthy

[Intro: Drakeo the Ruler]
Nigga stop playin', I just left Hsu Yun
I don't rap beef, I just know TECs and drums
And you ain't do it right if no detectives come
And I brought kate into the booth, ain't got no extra tie
You can say my wrist broke but my neck is fire
Flu flamm the rap game 'til I get extradited
Judging by my case files I'm obsessed with rifles
Had a meeting with the floggers just to say I'm they idol

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict (I don't rap beef)
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (for real)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (just sayin')
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you (nigga I don't rap beef)
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (I don't rap beef)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (you see it nigga)
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you

[Verse 1: Drakeo the Ruler]
Don't at me
Fuck it, please bro at me
They gon' have to find a suitable picture for Fox 11
You ain't learn from Cold Devil, I'm a nuisance, I'm tellin' you
Take a mud walk through Neimans like I got expensive power
I got dirty money on me but I just got out the shower
I'll shoot up everything, we ain't squabbling for hours
I can tell that nigga sour, plug talkin' with alfalfa
Know my attitude is childish, if I spoke to you be honored
I'm a flu flammer nigga, two pumps when I enter
Tryna break a Kylie Jenner, bitch I'm Drakeo, I'm a winner
Niggas in the Twitter fingers, if I shoot you there's no ending
The flashing lights on my pendant, I'm a legend out of prison
I'm a front door kicker, Liu Kang was my mentor
Off a five and a perc, two thirty was the printin'
Out of school from suspension, not because it was dismissal
And my dick old nigga, bro I know you niggas miss me

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict (I don't rap beef)
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (for real)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (just sayin')
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you (nigga I don't rap beef)
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (I don't rap beef)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (you see it nigga)
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
[?] dot it twice, dot the checks three times
I'm really used to chasing seconds in my free times
Claim they have enough so I had to serve 'em three times
Bitch I'm 03 so I'm watchin' out for one time
I can turn a hater to a motherfuckin' punchline
Down later gators with a motherfuckin' Glock nine
I got some designer and some weapons so I won't die
Won't we make it slap, we treat a rapper like a horsefly
Ride the wave, this ain't a boat ride
Yankee got the stick and Lil Kitty got the four-five
Locked tools, strapped up, and them niggas gon' try
Watch out for the G-Hive
I'm from the side where we G-Slide
I need blue hundreds on green guys (on green greens)
I'm off the mud and the tree slide
We out the slums, fresh out the slums

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict (I don't rap beef)
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (for real)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (just sayin')
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you (nigga I don't rap beef)
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (I don't rap beef)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (you see it nigga)
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you

[Verse 1: ALLBLACK]
Man who the fuck is top, so cold, I'm the one that's trife
Tee-Tee hate me 'cause I played the bitch twice
Yeah I know I'm out of pocket, I was playin' with life
I'm black and shiny, all gold, hold the ice
I'ma keep my jeans up my ankles and keep all my mics
Driver's seat, I'm gettin' rolled like a bike
I'm finna club live air baby, I ain't feelin' the yike
I'm at Benis, skim you well, Jackson chicken with rice
I'm too high off the molly, got my dick goin' soft
Plus her pussy bunk as hell and it smell like stroganoff
I remember pourin' powdered milk on Apple Jacks
Skippin' PE, stealin' shit out niggas' backpacks, it's BLACK

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
I'm too high off the coke, it got my dick goin' soft
These niggas do the cool jersey, I let the heat cool off
How you know it's good coke if you ain't snortin' the snow?
Test the work, these niggas scared to test the business
All these niggas focus on is havin' sex with bitches
Project niggas, I'm the one who made it out the trenches
Since the age of 18 I only seen 03 Thanksgivings
Thirteen K to see their Christmas
Wipe me down key, I feel some tension
Beside me, menage me, we be gettin' busy
Hide the work in her skirt, made her squirt when we get it
Breakin' down the work, we do division, ayy

[Verse 3: Nef the Pharaoh]
I'm on the molly with that flame like I'm Ghost Rider
I know the truth about your raps, you got a ghost writer
If you ain't never been in London on a double decker
Then you can't say it with your chest because you playin' checkers
I elevated on a nigga, made it hard to reach
I don't miss officers, this ain't Tha Carter 3
Her last nigga broke her heart 'cause she bargain for cheap
And then she came and sat with Chang and I sold her a dream
All praise to Allah, BLACK fuck with me
Cuttin' through these blue hundreds like a buck fifty
Why all these half ass niggas got they cup empty?
I'm 'bout to do the bitch pussy like dope did Whitney

[Chorus: ALLBLACK]
Stephen Curry how I ball out
LBJ how I ball out, ball out
Kyrie Irving how I ball out
I can't foul out, that bald nigga with his tongue out
Stephen Curry how I ball out
LBJ how I ball out, ball out
Kyrie Irving how I ball out
I can't foul out, that bald nigga with his tongue out

招搖過市他們覺得可怕
I don’t give a shit, 寫你的理由

幾萬塊的演出給我我不如旅遊
這樣的把戲也只能騙未成年
Cash比臉皮還厚, oh why you so poor? I don’t know
Living my life pick up the mic look at my eyes
說好要一起發大財
誰有困難就給幫助
誰難過就讓他開心
My ice like cold Toronto my life, 就像no tomorrow
用舌頭舔自己傷口沒有武器只有雙手
Welcome to the jungle

Keep that shit off of safety

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Keep a thirty shot clip, stay dangerous

Like cuz I'm blessed and famous
Lil cuzzo was a real gangbanger, face tats tryna cover the pain up
Off drugs and anger, used to trade our bangers
East side to the west, we was always hangin'
And I'm going up now but my life been changing
My lil hottie say I'm workin' just like Jamaican
You don't know who raised me, I'm a grape, you a raisin
Burnt out and turned down and you always hatin'
Doin' numbers, countin' green like I'm caught in the matrix
Laid back like Neo but ho I'm still crazy

Couldn't be no lame

Swervin' and swervin', switchin' lanes up on the speed bump
Post still drippin' hot sauce like Tapatío

I been did the jeans with the wings, that shit is regular
Your mans don't got over ten, you don't compare to us

[Intro]
Smoove, what's good, baby?
Thank you, Fizzle

[Chorus: Bambino]
Let go, let's go, shawty, let go
Yeah, we seein' bread, we eatin' bankrolls
At the W, fuck the lay-overs
She only 21, but her money way older
So let go, let's go, shawty, let's go
Yeah, we seein' bread, we eatin' bankrolls
At the W, fuck the lay-overs
Run this shit up and remain focused

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Let's go, lit like the stoves, get dough
Let's roll, break it down, let's leave
Wintertime, fall pass, that means it's less leaves
Harvest season, boot season, nigga, whatever
I just had to come with a reason to rock expensive sweaters
Use your weapons, Gucci leather, ridin' to Cold Devil
You know this Draco heavy, thousand dollar tools
Thousand dollar shoes
Drakeo and Bambino got Margielas, that's 03 different blues
03 got some different views
Just purchased a condo in the South 'cause I had deja vu
Birdhouse, bird brain, I had a different youth
Been flew out the nest, went in my chest, I had to make the news
Let's go, my mama used to pray for this in pews
Churches full of liars, I be preachin' in my interviews
Street nigga testimony, pop you if you test the homie
I just read on Malcolm X, By Any Means Necessary
And I felt the Holy Ghost inside my yard
I want the Wraith so I'ma kill the booth
Million dollar deal, gave my mom a chill
Gave my daughter gifts, thought I wasn't here
Almost shed a tear, glad I kept it real, 03

[Chorus: Bambino]
Let go, let's go, shawty, let go
Yeah, we seein' bread, we eatin' bankrolls
At the W, fuck the lay-overs
She only 21, but her money way older
So let go, let's go, shawty, let's go
Yeah, we seein' bread, we eatin' bankrolls
At the W, fuck the lay-overs
Run this shit up and remain focused

[Verse 2: Drakeo the Ruler]
Me and Maylene battling for custody, I can't let go
You know my Ruler drastic, I'm a nutso, klepto
An acronym, an F&N is on me, I'ma let go
Roll bounce on my neck, got VS on my set stone
Do these niggas dead wrong, shells rip through teflon
Picasso, paint a picture and it's vivid, on my Margielas
Nigga, pay attention, the olympics, brought my gold medals
Lyin' ass nigga, know Geppetto is your songwriter
I don't do the long typing, black ops, long sniping
It's gon' be a long night, disco ball, strobe lights
.223's, Bron and Mike, 03 just got out tonight
Free my nigga Ketchy and free Kel, bustin' niggas' eyes
Spendin' so much money on my pieces, make a nigga cry
Bin Laden when I ride, I'm off a twelve, you see my eyes
When opening the newspaper, only time I see my opps
Free my guys and free your wife, if niggas wanna beef, aight
Aiming, if he in my space, tell him the Twitter lies
Niggas thought they gave me life, ridin' in the spaceship light
Jeezy wanna take a ride, niggas wanna take my life
Star Wars laser fight, Drakeo like to play with life, ugh

But she don't get nothin'
Bustin' with me in the field 'cause we told on a nigga
Purple fountain like Shaquille

[Verse 3: ALLBLACK]
Yesterday I ran across this crazy ass page
Hips buyin' pussy, tricks on Snapchat, and hoes runnin' fades
A couple friends and famous rappers gettin' stripped on the blade
I even caught her Armenian goals tryna bust a few dates
The username was 304, sixteens, and weirdo
Shit looked worse than Red Eye when he got socked by Debo
Auntie sheriff sat me down and gave me the cheat codes
I was like Shaq, dunkin' on niggas but couldn't shoot free throws
Never went fed against the grain, show stopped ways
Ngigas will sacrifice they mama for a little bit of change
Never trust a nigga who run a pussy before he run plays
Never trust a nigga who choose Ruffles over Original Lays
Ralfy and 03 runnin' plays with 22NDWAYS

[Chorus: Ralfy the Plug]
Niggas boostin', ain't finna take shit from me
Chopsticks with mopsticks will knock down your big homie
Niggas boostin', ain't finna take shit from me

[Chorus]
All these money bags left me traumatized
Hit the cookie bag, now I'm hypnotized
When that beef is on we don't apologize
Most my niggas dead, didn't see age 25
All these money bags left me traumatized
Hit the cookie bag, now I'm hypnotized
When that beef is on we don't apologize
Most my niggas dead, didn't see age 25

[Verse]
Lost homies to the judge, lost homies to the gun
Ridin' 'round with a grudge, ridin' 'round with a drum
Young and I'm reckless
How could I be where I'm at in the game after that and I keep a protection
I'm in your bushes late night like a demon, you know I'm the creep of the section
I'm back and I'm flexin'
I got a picture of me in the session
Hop out on enemies at intersection
I'll never take the loss again, you know I paid the cost to win
You know I paved the way for them, I wanted three but all of them, ayy
Fuckers steady callin' in on me, next call was contained
Free all of my gang, let 'em out of the chains
All my dogs in the cage, all my dogs in the grave
I don't do it for the fame, I just do it for the grade

[Chorus]
All these money bags left me traumatized
Hit the cookie bag, now I'm hypnotized
When that beef is on we don't apologize
Most my niggas dead, didn't see age 25
All these money bags left me traumatized
Hit the cookie bag, now I'm hypnotized
When that beef is on we don't apologize
Most my niggas dead, didn't see age 25

I can't trust the enemy and I can't trust my fuckin' friend
I can't even trust this lil pussy nigga Benjamin
Frankly I was really only living for the listeners
Until I realized some of the wrong people listening

[Chorus]
Bright white, dice dice, top flight, dark Sprite
You can only understand me if you really move it
White knights, white dice, now I live a white life
Dancin' on the work, do the Vanilla Ice, two brick
Ice ice ice ice, I ain't talkin' jewelry
So icy like Gucci
Soldier like I'm Juvie
Quit the baller blocking, this is not a fuckin' movie

[Verse 2]
George Gervin (iceman)
George Jung (cash man)
Presidential George Bush, George of the Jungle
Ice man back when he was hurt he grabbed the ice pack
Ice pick, when you roll with this you need a few sticks
Ice checks, coolin' like a cooler 'cause my ice wet
Playing police roles like Ice T, and I got the Ice Cube
Big snake, cold world, life cool
I been breakin' out in people's faces what that ice do
High school, damn you was the man way back in high school
I just bought some shit I can't pronounce 'cause it was ice blue
Ice fool, ice fool, bitch I got them ice jewels
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, don't make me ice you
Icy nigga, icy licker, I just had a cold stripper
And she brought her wifey with her, and I think they real sisters
Icy body when I lick her, savage so I never kiss her
Fuck it I'm a nasty nigga

[Chorus]
Bright white, dice dice, top flight, dark Sprite
You can only understand me if you really move it
White knights, white dice, now I live a white life
Dancin' on the work, do the Vanilla Ice, two brick
Ice ice ice ice, I ain't talkin' jewelry
So icy like Gucci
Soldier like I'm Juvie
Quit the baller blocking, this is not a fuckin' movie

Man I swear without my Ray, my life's boring
Got a gold bank, got a gold check

If you with me then you're that good
Yeah yeah

You gonna make me put you in a suit and tie

[Intro]
My lil homie caught a
My lil homie caught a homi
My lil homie caught a body
First night out
He don't, he don't want no crimey
Aye, he don't want no crimey

[Chorus]
My lil homie caught a homi
Caught a case, he caught a body
Compton courthouse with a crimey
Where they do the gangsters grimy
Undercovers on assignment
Solitary his confinement
Jail the only way you make it off this island
My lil homie caught a homi
Caught a case, he caught a body
Compton courthouse with a crimey
Where they do the gangsters grimy
Undercovers on assignment
Solitary his confinement
Jail the only way you make it off this island

[Verse 1]
Bitch, you gotta be from underground to understand this shit
Bitch, you gotta be from out of town to want to buy this shit
Bitch, you gotta be from out of bounds to want to try this shit
You ain't gotta beef with Jordan, down to be the flyest bitch
Hatin' won't work 'cause I'm workin' 'til I'm tired bitch
Bitch, you had to been to county jail to live to tell this shit
Prison saved my life 'cause I know I was supposed to die that year
Bitches want my life so they just started actin' hella weird
Niggas want my wife, that's not my wife, might fuck my other bitch
Don't you close your eyes, we stayin' woke like Donald Glover, bitch
Watch her snort a line right off the dick before she suck the dick
Suffocate the pillow talk, just hold it down and smother shit
They comparing me to Pac so I got on some walkin' shit
Shout out to my lil homies hittin' licks and flockin' shit
I be in the studio 'cause I don't do no talkin', bitch
If I wasn't rappin', still be Gucci'd down and choppin' bricks

[Chorus]
My lil homie caught a homi
Caught a case, he caught a body

[Verse 2]
Bitch, who got the lean? Who got the xans? I need prescription shit
I'm from where we Crips will beef with Bloods and beef with Crips and shit
I'm from where before you get some kids, you get some sentences
I'm from where they spreading all the rumors and the sicknesses
I'm from where your favorite drug dealers might be witnesses
I'm from where some peoples caught on fire faking chemists
I'm from where they used to get the water with no fish and drip
I'm from where they treat a dead body like some fish 'n' chips
Eat your ass alive, you might get swallowed by a trinky bitch
She might look just like she is a model but got syphilis
I'm from where some bitches be more gangster than these niggas is
Half the time these killers really gay or really snitching shit
I'ma make myself a fuckin' general like [?]
Free my hitters, I could be in prison just like Ruthless is
I got extradited, I bailed out before you knew the shit
Fox was worried 'bout me, I was good but he the truth for this

[Chorus]
My lil homie caught a homi
Caught a case, he caught a body
Compton courthouse with a crimey
Where they do the gangsters grimy
Undercovers on assignment

[Chorus]
I'ma lay a nigga down, four hundred pounds
Straight up out the Jordan Downs, I got a hundred rounds
Drummer Gang, a hundred shell cases hit the ground
There go the peoples at the door, be quiet, don't make a sound

[Verse]
Throw your hood up for who put up and who restin' in peace
Sellin' water to the Mexicans, we don't have a beef

And when you sellin' kilos, gotta stay lowkey
I got homies sharin' baby mamas, rollin' the weed
Purple Summer, 03 the new 400 Degreez
I feel like Ron-Ron the Producer just like Manny to me
Fuck them evil ass bitches steady passin' the weed
What you need bitch? you need a project nigga
Drummer Gang shit, everybody pullin' triggers
Enemies might fuck your bitch and lock up with your sister
I'ma be the first real nigga with a Fisker
Don't trust her, don't trust shit
He swear he mafia but he be on some fuck shit
I might shoot you from a rental or a bucket
Hate on niggas, when you see 'em, switch the subject
Tired of rappers tryna hit the hood and take a pic
Wanna come out to the jungle and not get bit
The other day I hit sweet lady with that donkey dick
Don't you pop it bitch, fuck it, pop that pussy
Fuck it, smokin' cookies, fuck central booking
When 03 be in the projects, everybody looking
Never nook it, they can't wait 'til nigga's life get tooken
I'm from where my peoples crazy and the cops is crooked

Be quiet, tonight is the night that we ride
Pull up in the hood and see choppers inside

I'm used to riding Gran Coupes, G sliding
My streets is private and the view's worth a million dollars
Is you gon' sit still while a nigga walk it off?
When they crack the gate I'm right back balling
Would you come to the visits?
If they say I murdered a nigga and they had an eyewitness?
Would you help me hide if I jumped bail?
When they ask questions bitch don't tell
Would you have another nigga driving in my car?
Take the money out the safe and then fuck it off?
I'm asking all these lil questions 'cause I gotta know
If you don't answer right, bitch you gotta go

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
If I went down would you stay round?
If I went down would you stay round?

[Verse 3: Lil 100]
If I was locked up in the county would you write me?
Can I count you to be there, support me mentally?
Fuck your sympathy, I want your energy
Turn it into loyalty, name our daughter Royalty
Pay them lawyer fees if I go down
Would you hold me down, would you hold it down
Would you stay around?
Or would you switch like a snitch
Turn your back, get cold feet and jump ship
I don't need no broke bitch
I need a bitch who gon' listen
Cook dope out the pot, clean the kitchen
Don't be so promiscious
Can I trust you with my stash?
If they pop me would you secure bags?
Would you spend my last?
If I lost all I had
Would you visit me behind the glass?
I just have to ask, if I went down
Would you hold it down, would stay around
Would you hold me down?

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
If I went down would you stay round?
If I went down would you stay round?

Nigga burp like a motherfuckin' bear, ayy
You from the bottom, how your ass get here?

Shed weight, sub weight, kick her out, fix your face

Chasing the dividends, I'm getting chickens in
Keys to the Ben-en-enz, glad my job came with the benefits
I caught a case with the evidence
Money to lawyers made it disappear again
Met with Maria, she shook like Shakira did
Daddy the plug, only colors I see are blue benjamins
Purple diamonds in my overbite
Got me chewin' hard to eat steak and fries
On 285, got a doggy bag, sold dog food like Purina did
Brick after brick after brick after brick after brick after brick like a pyramid
Body got hieroglyphics like Egyptian
I don't what race I'm is, it's a mixture
My mama almost had me in the kitchen
I really grew up gettin' all the whippin'
I was a BeBe's kid how I'm baby loc crippin'
Purple hoodie, black hat on the mission
First day of school I dropped out of nutrition
I had to eat 'fore my daughter was Christian
I had a baby in high school
Fucked with lil baby, you know I was pitchin'
Baby mama mama taught me Spanish when ditching
I went to school with them white dudes

[Chorus: Key!]
Money keep going
Suck it, keep going
Money keep going
Suck it, keep going
Money keep going
Suck it, keep going

You better put your kids inside, somebody gon' get popped
I'm goin' through a lot, feel like we all we got

Lowkey at the spot, finally made it off the block

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh & 03 Greedo]
We in the Bay with it, we in LA with it
MIA with it, we don't play with it
We out in London, we out in Paris
California king now, I had an air bed
We in the Bay with it, we in LA with it
MIA with it, we don't play with it
We out in London, we out in Paris
California king now, I had an air bed
I've been down before, I blew up
I was on the blow-up bed
Now I'm that nigga from Los Angeles to New York
Bay Area to Memphis Tenn, yeah

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
I share hoes, she say her last nigga was a scarecrow
Me and Greedy Greed back to back in Sprinter Benz
It's 2018, it's 'bout time that they let some niggas win
My body tatted and my passport matchin'
I'm addicted to traveling, I'm an airport addict
You just 21, you is not no savage
I am stackin' for them days, I am not gon' have it
I'ma pull a drakey out the bag, fuck a rabbit
Now watch him get to hoppin' like a bunny when I clap it
I be overseas, you ain't never left Cali
At the shows with the Queen Bey and I met Khaled
I'm booked, ain't no more room on my calender
This Hellcat'll burn the fuck out your Challenger
High school dropout, I ain't graduate
But I got rich, fed my family, then my niggas ate

Fives, tens, twenties, fifties, hundreds
Bitch you ain't the one I want, I wanted
Shoot your shot, the chopper hold a hundred

Look here bitch
I don't give a fuck about no good hair bitch
We can get some money out some good head bitch
I just keep on sayin' it's a good year bitch
I been blowin' up like a Goodyear blimp
But nigga don't tempt me
I'ma squeeze my finger on the chopper 'til it's empty
Know I keep that Bun B, rest in peace Pimp C
If UGK, best be ridin' dirty with me
I feel like a legend, got some time to do in Texas
I can't make a statement, guess they just don't get the message
Smokin' lines, sippin' lean, know that line ain't hit the 'znie
Just sendin' them tracks out of town, address it

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh & 03 Greedo]
We in the Bay with it, we in LA with it

But gangbanging, no selling dope in my music
I'm talkin' 'bout the past life, you feel me?
When I get out I'ma be a millionaire, I came in here with nothin, feel me?
You ain't never got to cross no nigga to get where you're goin'
That ain't gon' do nothin' but get a nigga hurt

But I'll be right back sooner than you think
You dig?

Gettin' high in high end, knock out like I'm Tyson

She ain't love me 'til she saw me shine
Playin' with a nigga all this time
You ain't love me 'til you saw me shine
Playin' with a nigga all this time
She wear a minute, now I'm on your mind
Since I lost Lil Money I been on my grind
Always been one hundred, never told her lies
I can't let her go, I will never really know why
Shay Shay you got my attention
Sorry for times I went missing
Have you heard 'bout whose lips I'm kissin'
I understand why you keepin' your distance
But I still love you
And I never care who done fucked you
Been in this game, I can't judge you, wave it above you
That's what these lames do
Know I done played you so I can't blame you
But why you so playful? don't make me hate you
I never fake and act like you wasn't there when I had nothing at the bottom
Now I'm at the top, that's why anything that you ever wanted,  know you got it
Sucker for love, fuck with a thug

[Intro: 03 Greedo]
03, ayy
Drummer Gang in this thang, make it bang
Choppa, I don't need no aim (Matt Brick$)
SOB x RBE in this bitch
Yhung T.O. and 03 in this shit
Ron Ron do that shit, Beat Boy taught me

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Gucci penny loafers to my big blue faces
I'ma keep it packed like the Gucci suitcases
Crippin', but I stay away from chubby shoelaces
Hit his ass once, but he bled in two places
Rosé everything, got expensive taste, bitch
""How you clean your ice?"" Bitch, I use toothpaste
That baby faced baby loc, baby sit in paper
Child support? Yeah, right, my BM gettin' payments

[Verse 2: Yhung T.O]
Young nigga got rich and I ain't looked back since
I got diamonds in my mouth, I got clips on clips
I got sauce, might drip, I got straps like T.I.P
I got shooters on call, them niggas shoot, don't miss
I got times I quit, but them times ain't shit
Sent your niggas on a skit, don't get respect for assist
I got times when I'm calmin', most times might trip
All these niggas wanna ride and ain't providin' a lift

[Verse 3: 03 Greedo]
Buy my bitch a purse, for my daughter and my shooter
It's $10,000 for a verse, you won't show if you a loser
Yeah maybe you is real, but a pussy introduce us
If I feel that you is real, I might just do it off the strength
A nigga, bossman, ice man, buzzin'
She creep up like a wolf, I make a howlin' sound, she bust it
Goddamn, we just friends, fuck it
That pussy got me hooked so I might make her be my woman

[Verse 4: Yhung T.O]
Got some niggas that'll slide if he dubbin' this bitch
Love'll get you killed, and you lovin' that bitch
If I had to make a choice, I'd make a nigga strip
I need money, every dollar, every chain in this bitch, nigga
Fuck fame, all my niggas gettin' paid
And these niggas don't want smoke, all these niggas gettin' saved
Niggas talk crazy when they typin' on that page
I got demons in real life for niggas thinkin' that they brave

[Verse 5: 03 Greedo]
Any side of California, people know I'm very loyal
Strap game made me royal, rap game made me spoiled
She doin' my dreads butt-naked with Jamaican oils
I'm eatin' Jamaican food and bumpin' rouges early mornin'
Hella horny, I can't fuck a bitch if her lil' body bony
She say, ""Boy, you sleepin', I'ma teach you"" then she hopped up on it
Goddamn, she get it in, I'ma fuck everybody
I be out here shittin' on these niggas like a port-a-potty

[Verse 6: Yhung T.O.]
All these diamonds on my neck, I'm the main attraction
I'm that nigga, settin' plays like I'm Phil Jackson
Sendin' shots without no guns, that's a lil' backwards
Suckers sufferin' financially, niggas Twitter trappin'
And you will get your ass smoked with all that Twitter yappin'
I mean like way less talk and more interaction
Got some niggas I can't trust that I'm still attached with
Know some niggas who be actin' but they really actresses

[Verse 7: 03 Greedo]
Jordan down, project party, turn it to a private party
Had to spend the night with shawty, woke up eatin' calamari
Finna cop a white Ferrari, smash up on the cops, I'm sorry
Blow a bag and cop BVLGARI, iPhone X, forgot the charger
Genius, but I'm half-retarded, walkin' with the MAC and target
Bitch, I push a hard bargain, blowin' on Nintendo cartridge
Racks, my bitch on Dolly Parton, big titties
Knockin' at the door, she flodgin', end up on that milk carton, bitch nigga

[Verse 8: Yhung T.O]
All my niggas really demons, get to shootin' for no reason
Catch a sucka tryna slide and have him standin' where we leave him
And I'm goin' 'gainst the odds, but all my hundred dollars even
All my niggas with the beefin', all you niggas turn to bleedin'
I don't even want your bitch, still I take her  for the weekend
I got money on my mind, I know exactly what you thinkin'
I know temptation, and bitch, you'd be a dumb bitch to tempt me
I got triggers on these semis, squeezin' 50 'til it's empty, bitch

All that other shit make a nigga mad
All these niggas tryna take a nigga's swag
Had to show off 'cause a nigga got his bag
On Rodeo every weekend

[Verse 1: Drakeo the Ruler]
Lord, keep me away from these bums
Nick Cannon, rapping all out my drum
Ayy bitch, ain't no up next, I'm the one
2-2-3 shells all on my rug
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
This swamp water that I mixed with my mud
Fat daddies like I'm Ralfy the Plug
But it's the Ruler, fuck with me, gon' get slumped

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
On Rodeo but I still got my drum
Thought I had life until I posted a dub
Man tell these niggas I'm as real as they come
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
On Rodeo but I still got my drum
Thought I had life until I posted a dub
Man tell these niggas I'm as real as they come

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
White girl my princess, perfume smell like nail polish
Sell product, bailed out two times on one case and we still mobbin'
Heard that we seamless but guarantee won't tell 'bout it
Play games with this TEC and I'ma spit a couple shells out it
Nintendo Switch on this handheld
Mario Kart, watch the tail slide out
Brand new foreign car bought with my advance
Thinking you can see us, take another glance
I wear PP with Buscemi, treat that shit like Vans
My nigga Ralfy kickin' shit, board in his hands
Skateboard P with the grams
Diamond tester make Neptune sounds
Milkshake like Kelis how they dance
Leave that bitch in the field was the plan
Bowlegged with the three point stance
Bitch I'm a beast, yes I am
It's the wolf with the lamb chop
Now watch a ghost on your stage, stuck again
Here I am, here I am

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
On Rodeo but I still got my drum
Thought I had life until I posted a dub
Man tell these niggas I'm as real as they come
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
On Rodeo but I still got my drum
Thought I had life until I posted a dub
Man tell these niggas I'm as real as they come

[Verse 3: Drakeo the Ruler]
Just hopped off IMO in my thug
They like Drakeo man you back on that bull
Duh bitch, don't you see all this mud?
Coupe abuser, don't you see all these guns?
Up in Bally Total Fitness where I make all my runs
Cold Devil, draggin' minks on the floor
Ain't nobody finna book me, ask these niggas, yeah they know
Get you whacked for these goodies and this Gladback on the floor
Yeah mister fucking Mose, pay attention to my quotes
I'm a menace, ask Dennis, man I'm sinister with arms
Brains missing in the orange, tryna get these lucky charms
Call of duty, yeah it's war, black opps on the floor
Drinking pints when I'm scorched, man these niggas know the score
How I pull up, have to blame Bin Laden for the Porsche
Drinking pints when I'm scorched, man these niggas know the score
How I pull up had to blame Bin Laden for the Porsche, the Ruler

[Chorus]
I'm from Grape Street, where we G-slide
(G-slide and hit your Ricky ass)
Sweet Shay Shay, would you be mine?
You know I like 'em dark skin like Shay Shay
Got that pretty smooth skin like Fay Fay
I think Shanini got a body like Tata
She fuck with Greedy 'cause he fuck her like a pornstar
Freaky-deeky, heard her pussy got that voodoo
I know she gay but I done fell in love with Poo Poo
Sex appeal like butt butt, I'm like ooh woo
Go to court for a nigga like why goo

[Verse 1]
Fuck around and drop some codeine in my champagne
She going in like diamond lane in the diamond lane
She going down like the motherfuckin' stock exchange
Addicted like some cocaine to the campaign
I like the 'woods, kiss the motherfuckin' ashtray
One more time for Poo Poo, bet you I can make that ass shake
Baby I can get you straight, don't act gay
Fuck it, I won't interrupt you, get them stacks bae
I'm in Atlanta, you know one day I'll be back bae
Support my daughter May May, no back pay
If I gotta creep up on you with a masked face
Or put these bitches on the blade, fuck Backpage (fuck that)
Doin' numbers like a motherfuckin' facts page
Seventh letter, crooked ladder, get your facts straight (bangin')
All you niggas quick to tell, it's a rat race
Waste your time hating, I'ma go and rack chase

[Verse 2]
Sweet lady
Grape Street lady, think she tryna have my baby
She know to have that sex appeal like Maury
She know to always keep it trill like BA
I do her wrong but I ain't in to being sorry
My other hottie left a nigga for a flea J
He ain't rollin' with no money, he a cheapskate
Oh I'm just tryna get a ticket like a sweepstakes
I love my hottie dumb thick like cheesecake
Run that bitch like Diddy, have you walkin' for some cheesecakes
Makin' that band say I'm the man 'cause that D came
Had a bitch that look like Cassie workin' three blades
I got a bitch who fuck me off the syrup, booty out
Smuggling something, got a porno over Mookie house
She got a body on her, pockets healthy
Which one look better, is it Kendra, is it Elthy?
I need a miracle, might ask the lord to help me
She a project bitch but look hella clean
Just a couple up-and-comers that be on the scene
Fuck her once under the covers like a bone meat
Got her wishin' it was some way she could clone me
I'ma just pull up somewhere up the road, she's really lonely

[Chorus]
I'm from Grape Street, where we G-slide
(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Sweet Shay Shay, would you be mine?
You know I like 'em dark skin like Shay Shay

[Bridge]
I like all the hotties with the colors in their hair
Tats on they face with the buds in they ear

Bang my whole gang and you know I won't care

Watch a young nigga, ball, ball, ball
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Outro]

Oh, can't forget Nae Nae, she thick as a bull
GiGi she had all that ass, I ain't really seen her too much after the baby, but you see what was goin' on, haha
They say Pooka got it in, they don't talk about how, why, when, and where, hahaha
Hey, hey, if you from the Jordan Downs then come over there
Whoa whoa whoa
Too many hotties in my section, I want 'em all
Call me Greedy 'cause I want 'em all
Call me Greedy 'cause I want 'em all
I get GiGi 'cause I wanna ball

[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I remember niggas turned on me
Niggas actin' like they never really heard of me
Now I'm hoppin' out with pistols, let it burn on 'em
Watching how the tables turned on 'em

[Verse: Maxo Kream]
Treat your niggas like your brothers, you would never turn your back
Right or wrong for your brothers, you would bust a nigga cap
Used to mob deep as hell, you had a hundred niggas strapped
Now you locked up in jail, where them hundred niggas at?
Probably tryna fuck your main, they ain't worried 'bout you, nigga
But they screaming free your name on they Instagram and Twitter
Niggas cappin' for the 'gram but they ain't give you one dollar
How that post to be your mans, but he ain't checkin' on your momma?
Took away your commissary, think the boss man on some jelly shit
Had 50 bands on you, but they put it with the evidence
Your name ring bells, still eating in the county
Before you made it to your cell, you had soups and brownies
You gon' eat regardless, but your niggas left you starvin'
But when the drama pop off, you the first one they callin'
Remember whatchamacallit took the box and stole the pounds
And you pulled up on his block, with the Glock and gunned him down
Caught him lackin' from behind, you cocked the 9 and popped the iron
Put your life on the line, but your niggas let you down
You ain't bitchin', you ain't cryin', got a heart of a lion
No snitchin', testifyin', day for day, you do the time
Your lawyer said your homie snitchin', you thought it was a lie
Then you read that black and white, broke your heart and crushed your pride
The same blood nigga that you called your lil' bro
The same lil' nigga droppin' names like a hoe
Took him to interrogation, he was posin', fake stiff
Let them crackers fast talk him, now he shakin' like a bitch
Laws threw some time at him, started singin', Taylor Swift
Told on you for a Coca-Cola and some cigarettes
Cut from a different cloth, these fuck niggas made different
Screamin' ""death before dishonor"", swear to God, you really live it
Laws tried to question you, you told them crackers burn in hell
Take a .38 shell before you ever talk to 12

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I remember niggas turned on me
Niggas actin' like they never really heard of me
Now I'm hoppin' out with pistols, let it burn on 'em
Watching how the tables turned on 'em

[Outro: 03 Greedo]
I've been betrayed, I've been betrayed
Hoppin' out with Ks, aimin' at they face
Bitch, I've been betrayed, I've been betrayed
Hoppin' out with Ks, aimin' at they face

These bitches tryna act like bitches, good Hannah Montana
But I know she got like Miley Cyrus
Goddamn homie, how you change like a light get
He was all in, scared of them life sentences
I am not afraid, I'm not a media witness
Wasn't tryna send you home, but with a lighter sentence
Shawty wanna ride, I think she need a ticket
Ticket on my head from the opposition
Stinc sack with a lil card 'cause that sack went missing
Still in the field, still in the field tripping
HamdouliLlah, nigga my shoes is Christians
She's on a date, she's out on business
Remember when it felt like I ain't have a pot to piss in
Now I can't stop the chopper from kicking
Give a young nigga an early dismissal
Lil bitch is a weak link
Came up short, now that bitch can't reach me
The bitch that make it look easy
Know the feds watching but I hope they don't see me
White girl, real chopper, she know men, she like Phoebe
Tried to put that trick on repeat
Brag about that bitch, bet that bitch evil
Tell a bitch do not try, tell her go home, tell her get by
And if I get caught money pass prepaid man, ah
Ah, ah, greedy, ayy, go, oh, too greedy, oh

[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Every day we wanna meet hoes at the strip club
Bitches ain't showin' no pussy and shit
You know what I'm saying
How much this shit cost?
How much it cost for me to see you half naked?
Nah, bitch, you just gon' show your nipples or something?
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
How much it cost for me to see you half naked?
I only came outside the house with half a bag, ayy
How much it cost to get some brain while I lane switch?
Fuck you when you got the change, money ain't shit
Ayy, ayy, bitch wasted
Fuck it, I'm wasted
Ayy, ayy, bitch wasted
Fuck it, I'm wasted, ayy

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
How much it cost for me to see you half naked?
How much it cost to bust it down like an AP?
She told me good pussy really worth the payment
I paid the cost, we go half on a baby
She tryna have a soul child, she half crazy
Bitch, there ain't no money, we can get it out the pavement
I ain't tryna trick ya, tryna put you on the slave ship
Get it out the zombie, so she workin' on the grave shift
Turn a trick, get that change on a late night
Suck this dick in a Range on a late night
Focus on the campaign on a late night
Stay awake off cocaine on a late night

What's fake about her? Her ass and tits
I ain't no leech, I ain't no bum, I ain't no fuckin' dummy
I'm tryna put this dick in your tummy
I don't believe her when she say she love me
Love is dead, lil' bitch, I ain't no fuckin' mummy

Niggas best beware when we show up
All my niggas carry a blower
You could get your whole block tore up

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
As a kid I was strapped on the bus
All the crips used to call it the cuss
All the crips used to call it the sus
All of these bitches was sus
It ain't a nigga I trust
I'ma pull up and I bust
You know we don't give a fuck
We used to crip walk with our fingers
I never thought I would be singin'
I never thought I would be blingin'
'Cause I was right there like I'm Chingy
I be strapped when I'm walkin' in Neimans
Never ever been a Marcus
Big bag, he stingin'
Got it out the flea market

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]

[Verse 2: AD]
In the lab I keep a blammer on me, 'case I ever hear the cold world
Swing to Vegas for the big guns, bullets lookin' size of cold waters
Got the forty for me ese, keep a fifty in his old chopper
We ain't playin' when we hit the court, we be ballin' like them Globetrotters
Hoes be playin', never fucked a nigga, when a nigga had them broke pockets
All these presidents up in my jeans, they all dead, I call them ghost pockets
We got weapons like the Ghostbusters, I won't go out if it's no problem
Little homies with the gotti thirst, Nike store, we boostin' Foamposites
Triple ounce, they eatin' healthy cake, then I hit the lab with Greedo
From the gutter, probably never change, homie still drinkin' Titos
Cracker smoke you every Friday, jackin' niggas like Debo
Insane diss then you can lose your mama, you the new Finding Nemo

[Intro]
I've been meditating with the money
Prayin' for the paper
Focused on the funds (TrePounds)

[Chorus]
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
I done always kept that shit one hundred
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
But I done always kept that shit one hundred
One hundred, one hundred
I done always kept that shit one hundred

[Verse 1]
Hundred miles they runnin'
Offer me a run and all, your girlfriend got to runnin'
You gon' probably hear me 'fore you see me comin'
Turn a bitch to Stevie Wonder, I was pushin' keys
Go hard and I black on the street
Put the crack in the streets
Heard fake make it shake, yeah I had to get the cheese
I'm a wolf, you are lookin' like it's something to eat
Gotta feed me like the eagles, scream every week
If I went down when we was deep
Would you come down and still be freaky?
All that phone sex left her leakin'
This call keep on beepin'
And she can't see why that phone keep hanging up for no reason

[Chorus]
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
I done always kept that shit one hundred
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
But I done always kept that shit one hundred
One hundred, one hundred
I done always kept that shit one hundred

[Verse 2]
Focused on the funds, loading up my drum
Probably ain't nothing but the crumbs, I been counting up the hundreds
Type of money bought her everything she wanted
Now their hair braided like their name was Pocahontas
She tryna chase me like an animal she huntin'
Every time I pull up, she start gunning, oh
She shoot it down like it's nothing
I was counting up blue hundreds
I ain't never change, stackin' up the paper
I could never change, I ain't never been no hater
Always been one hundred, I was everything she wanted, oh
She don't want a broke boy, she need a nigga getting hundreds

[Chorus]
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
I done always kept that shit one hundred
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
But I done always kept that shit one hundred
One hundred, one hundred
I done always kept that shit one hundred

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
Run up a check like a track star, shoot a three, no backboard
What's a goon to black boy?, i ain't scared, I ain't scared
It's Halloween all year, codeine all year
Shawty high off a perc dry, I know your vision ain't clear
Ain't have no pot to piss in, you ain't give me no hand when I needed it
Best friends turned snake in front of my eyes, couldn't believe the shit
I just had to level up on 'em, Forgiatos on the truck on 'em
Your baby mama backstage on the tour bus, lettin' me fuck on her
Fifty racks when I walk inside the Neimans, that's gettin' blowed quick
Overseas havin' that Cali pack on me, I got it in shipments
Black bitch in a foreign ride, steering wheel on the other side
I tuck the dope in between her thighs, I'm livin' like I'm televised

Fuck that, I'm wifin' bitches
Keep it with me like a license picture
Pretty lady with the pink hair
Legs folded like a pink flamingo
Pink dolphin give me all the freakies
Poppin' off me like my diamonds Fiji
I like my diamonds purple, representing that's [?]
Purpled down like a Teletubbie, I remember I was Barney blowing
Up it since I heard The Jacka on me
Every summer stayed in Sacramento
I was trappin' on the mack road
E pills had me on the come oat
I got to stretch out when I'm on the road
Shittin' on niggas, I really sell dope
Margiela, offset with the coat
I had to green up the ice and the coke
I got the lean but it's for me to bowl
Shout out to Future, F Beezy the movie
I'm too paranoid, I can't skeet in a groupie
I got a shooter with ice on Osama
Who's stackin' the commas, who's still wearin' goofy

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
I got them Futures on my feet, I feel like Pluto

Then my mama locked the door, I was sleepin' on the floor
Now I'm fuckin' on your ho, and she stealin' from the store

Every week I called home, 'fore a nigga went to jail

We ain't from where this beach die
On the side, keep heat by
Who got the drugs for the cheap buy
Fill 'em in, that creep life
Went from oatmeal cream pie
Back in the pen, now it's ten for the fee price
They took way more of the ten, guarantee I'll be fine
I be doggin' all my bitches and they boyfriends feline, yeah

Should've left the bitch instead, now it's nothin' to get dead, kill him then I get some head
From another nigga bitch, oops I did that shit again
Blame it on the Brit Spears, why these niggas steady playin', call a nigga every spears
Face a nigga fears, wet him like some tears, all these niggas weird
Fuck these niggas hatin', all these bitches sayin'

[Intro: Rexx Life Raj]
I remember young nigga wanna be a dope boy
Ridin' 'round town in my whip on dubs
Young nigga wanna be a dope boy
See 'em talk down but your bitch show love, now I'm up
Stylin' with the glow, boy, bossed up like a dope boy, I'm up
From the Regal to the Rolls Royce, bossed up like a dope boy

[Verse 1: Kap G]
Yeah, if you had a Rolex then you was a dope boy
Nike Cortez, they don't know boys
Tryna get a check even though we were broke, boy
I got bitches talkin' fresh like they run around with coke, boy
RIP to Troup, all my hundreds blue
'Member JP used to have them nicks in his shoes
Now we ballin' every day like we came up on the plug
Why you all up in my face? You just now showin' love
Had some homies turn to 12, they ain't with me
I might whip you with my belt, yeah, that's LV
I just keep it to myself, I'm so empty
Just be busting down a bale of some OG
I was just a youngin lookin' up to OG's
You know we won't leave a trace for the police
She just wanna give me face, that's emoji
I might fly out to the Bay just to smoke weed

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
I remember young nigga wanna be a dope boy (Be a dope boy)

From the Regal to the Wraith
I can tell what he thinkin', see the evil in his face (Sucker)
Hundred thou' cash, got it stuffed in the safe
Hope I never get to touch it, leave it for a rainy day (Uh-uh)
It's hate in your pores and umbrellas in the doors
Used to serve winos and watch 'em stumble to the store (Seminary)
The closest people to you try to hurt you the most
Poppin' bottles in the club, celebrate when we toast (It's Philthy)
10K a show, seventy-five for a host
A real nigga show up to them flyers that I post (Solid)
Motivate the youth and give the hood niggas hope
No, I don't gangbang, but fuck with Bloods and the Locs (I do)
Test drivin' Bentley trucks before they came out
These Jordans two weeks early, they ain't even came out (Is that right?)
Sucker got smoked, you should've never came out
At every video shoot, I'm bringin' every chain out, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
I remember young nigga wanna be a dope boy (Be a dope boy)
Ridin' 'round town in my whip on dubs
Young nigga wanna be a dope boy (Be a dope boy)

From the Regal to the Rolls Royce, bossed up like a dope boy

[Verse 3: 03 Greedo]
I can never tell these young niggas, ""Go and be a dope boy""
I just got sentenced to 20 long years
Be prepared for what come with Baby Loc, boy
Treat my lil' homies like my own damn kids
I remember I was low, boy
Started knockin' at your door, boy, sellin' all the dope, boy
Sendin' all these hoes, boy
Bangin' Baby Loc, niggas ain't really makin' no noise
Got the loud in my gut
You scared to hit the back, ain't allowed in the trap
If that bitch was actin' gay, she ain't allowed on the truck
All you niggas actin' lame, you ain't allowed on my track
Fake tough, tryna flex, no pressure
Every time I pour lean, I don't measure
Man, I'm coolin' with a knock on the block
No, I'm not smoked out, I just beat a drug test

Pressure make diamonds, then I'm diamond tester
Can't walk a mile in my Masion Margielas
I got the Benz, peanut butter leather
Space Jam jays, they padded leather
Gun a Beretta, pour a two just to feel better
Might be fly, but I'm way fresher
You got from Mike and I got it from Hector
Invest in that lean and that liquid I make
My life is a movie, no it's an adventure
Finding my chain when I got arrested
Must have been my best investment
The clothes that I wear, that was made by me
All of this lean that I sell in these streets
I wrestle with snakes and I argue with thieves
Invest in my bitch and I got her a weave
My car in her name but I got the key
Invest in these pills and I'm sellin' xannies
Police behind me, I'm actin' [?]
Invest in this warrant, I got my army
God protect me from my enemies
Bought it for five and I sell for a G
Flipped every cent, now I need my money

You leave me down with the drugs
So you know I'm official, I go on a mission

Judgin' no soul with no disses, pay the jade do the dishes
I know you copy the flow, the shit that you sayin' really fictious
Run up three my initials, drummer gang tot pistols
I'm a fucker, never kiss her, when the mail get delivered
Good gas every Wednesday, make it snow in the summer
Go gold and purple summer, made my own marijuana
I don't wear Abercrombie, walk around off the addy
Walk around like it summer, tell these fuck niggas

Distant, distant, dis', different flavors, woo
X on the beat, make it boom

[Chorus]
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Get her pregnant, I told that ho to have my baby
She going crazy, she screaming like that bitch in labor
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Keep it player, I like my hoes in different flavor, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Every time I hit, I just can't lie, I had to taste it

[Verse 1]
Ooh, different flavors, bitch I got a different flavor
I don't save her, I don't think that I can save her
But I love her, I can't lie, I know I love her
She get the money, you know I love to get the money
Ain't acting funny, that bitch ain't never acting funny
She hit the bully, a bully on a fuckin' bully
The boulevard, she'll never pull my card
I go too hard, I fuck around and break your heart
I get the car, I get the cars, that's push to start
I don't drive far, purple with the tan guts
PBJ fresh out the jar, drippin' like I'm Messy Marv
Get the bag and make 'em starve, she recognize she with a star

[Chorus]
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Get her pregnant, I told that ho to have my baby
She going crazy, she screaming like that bitch in labor
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Keep it player, I like my hoes in different flavor, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Every time I hit, I just can't lie, I had to taste it

[Verse 2]
She got flavor, more flavor than a 'frigerator
Brand new freezer, I'm way too cold to ever taste her
Ain't no hatin', told that bitch I'm not no hater
I put the blocks inside the plastic like vanilla wafers
I get the paper out the package, never graduated
And I be out here serving niggas like a fuckin' waiter
I got too much on my plate, she got too much of the cake, ayy ayy
I got too much on my plate, she got too much of the cake, ayy ayy

[Chorus]
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Get her pregnant, I told that ho to have my baby
She going crazy, she screaming like that bitch in labor
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Keep it player, I like my hoes in different flavor, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Every time I hit, I just can't lie, I had to taste it, ooh

[Outro]
I had to taste
Different, different, a different, a different flavor
Ayy, ah-ayy, a different, ayy, ayy, ayy
I had to taste her, ooh, damn, goddamn, goddamn
Ayy, ayy, ayy, a different flavor

[Intro: 03 Greedo]
I'm not the type
I'm not the type
I'm not the type
Sum up the difference
I'm something too different
Something too different
Dave-O, make me a slap

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I'm not the type to just sit in the house
Bitch, I'm the type to go figure it out
I'm not the type to type tough shit on Twitter
I push a button, go get me a nigga
I'm something too different
Just to sum up the difference
My OG told me that I had to lose just to gain
Sum up the difference
I'm something too different, to sum up the difference

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Ain't the type to talk shit, let you talk back
Bitch, I'm the type to leave a nigga where the chalk at
I ain't one to talk to the pigs, where my cell at?
Niggas never trapped interstate, where my jail at?
You ain't in the trenches, where the mil' at?
Nigga, you ain't scale that
Nigga, you ain't sell that
You just probably smelled that or hit that
Tell these pussy niggas get back
We don't do the parties or the kick-backs
Got beef, that's a big snack
Run up on me, leave a few stacks
I could drop ten, that's a fuckin' feature
Stomp a nigga out in the Raf sneakers

[Chorus: 03 Greedo & Philthy Rich]
I'm not the type to just sit in the house
Bitch, I'm the type to go figure it out
I'm not the type to type tough shit on Twitter
I push a button, go get me a nigga
I'm something too different
Just to sum up the difference
My OG told me that I had to lose just to gain
Sum up the difference (Ayy, it's Philthy, nigga)
I'm something too different, to sum up the difference (Uh-huh, look)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Niggas'll steal from you, tryna help you find it (Suckers)
Money on your head, the closest nigga lyin' (12)
Lil Ant was two years old when he felt designer (Swear to God)
Bitch pussy wore out, couldn't feel the lining (Bitch)
My niece mad, ain't no paintings of her in my house (Is that right?)
Me and her mama beefin', we ain't gon' hash it out (Uh-uh)
Pressed up a thousand CD's just to pass 'em out (Oh, I remember)
Niggas ain't want to buy 'em, now they cashin' out (It's Philthy)
Got my ass whooped every week because I didn't listen (I couldn't listen)
Kicked out of school, nigga couldn't pay attention (I couldn't pay attention)
The OG's always told me I was somethin' different
Now I'm worth a few mil' to sum up the difference, It's Philthy

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I'm not the type to just sit in the house
Bitch, I'm the type to go figure it out
I'm not the type to type tough shit on Twitter
I push a button, go get me a nigga
I'm something too different
Just to sum up the difference
My OG told me that I had to lose just to gain
Sum up the difference
I'm something too different, to sum up the difference

Only Grape Street nigga with a project with Uzi
And I told y'all move it
Still broke ass nigga worried 'bout Thursday and Tuesday
Duckin' curly hair like the shit was a movie
Ooh, baller blockin' and you niggas flockin'
All my niggas gettin' money, trappin' was a hobby

Baby daddy ain't shit with his faggoty ass

Sippin' all this syrup while I come with all this slick talk, ayy

I'm the Grape Street Juvie, Peter Roll Stunna

Just bought some new choppers and them drums holdin' a hundred
Walk with a limp 'cause my knots heavy
Play and you get popped, hold the Glock steady
Only broke niggas beef, so I ain't trippin'
Just 'cause I keep it cool don't mean I ain't crippin', huh?

Got a million dollar swag, hit a lick, huh?
You be hatin', pillow talkin' to your bitch, huh?

Damn, that girl sexy, lil' mama got cash too

Backwoods full of bud
White cups full of drank
I came with molly but my molly [?]
Hit that shit, don’t baby sit it
Hit that shit, don’t baby sit it
Sip that shit, don’t baby sit it
Sip that shit, don’t baby sit it

I [?], finally got some money
Used to be a druggie
No cash, dress bummy
Now I’m getting paper all over like a mummy
Still keep the white girl
No Playboy bunny
Ball and get hot
Like I’m Clyde, keep a Bonnie
But my Bonnie’s name is Nina
People leaning on my [?]
Sittin’ on my lap, clap clap
We performin’
Bitches [?]
So the bitches started swarming
Bitch shake sum
Ain’t you up in here to make sum?
Yeah they call me Greedy
But deceive me and I won’t taste nothin’
Never on the first night
Savage but I’m classy
Sippin’ high tech, got a champagne glass
Red with the Ricky Rosé
No phantom and VIP access
So a nigga had to
Now let lil mama hit it
She ain’t say it taste nasty
Tell her is we fucking
She say you ain’t gotta ask me

Backwoods full of bud
White cups full of drank
I came with molly but my molly [?]
Hit that shit, don’t baby sit it
Hit that shit, don’t baby sit it
Sip that shit, don’t baby sit it
Sip that shit, don’t baby sit it

Looking for the lean
Hit Greedy with for the clean coke
Trap got cameras
You get shot looking through peep holes
Beating on my chest, [?] trees like King Kong
I ain’t with the going back and forth games, ping pong
I be getting all my cocaina from the migos
Get all of my gold from the people [?]
Got a lot of homies with that knock knock, ding dong
Who’s home?
[?] be so solid, they should carve it in my tombstone
Let’s hit this Remmy
Tell me, do you do coke?
Molly on them xannies
Better tell the truth hoe
Been on, you was dulo
You just old pussy
Used to hit with a new [?]
Any time you drinking, you know Greedy finna do more
Even in the county, I was loaded off of pruno
When I was in prison, we had real liquor
Punk bitch, you in the presence of a real nigga
Deal with it

Backwoods full of bud
White cups full of drank
I came with molly but my molly [?]
Hit that shit, don’t baby sit it
Hit that shit, don’t baby sit it
Sip that shit, don’t baby sit it
Sip that shit, don’t baby sit it

Backwoods full of bud
White cups full of drank

Yeah
You lil bitch ass niggas steady speaking up on the low
If these project walls could talk
They'll be just like 03, you dig?
03

[Chorus]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

[Verse 1]
I remember robbin' Paisas every other Friday
I remember money house, I'm selling out of molly
I remember in Atlanta talking pounds at Follies
I remember laying down bullets in my body
If you know you finna fold then get the fuck from by me
If you ain't finna hold it down then you can't be my crimey
Greedy get the guap and play the game but keep it grimey
I've been shot by who I love and told on by my family
I've been double crossed and bird fed
One time they sucker punched a nigga
Yeah they knocked me out like Ronda Rousey
Blindside you with this bullet if you come around me
Seen you at this party, was gon' hit you, you was fucking outie

[Chorus]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve

You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

Who put that lean in two liters?
Dreadlocks like Beanie Man, I'ma red beam you
Hit your white whip up, you know I'm gon' cream you
Act in Lime-A-Rito's, it's no Lime-A-Rita
Really sell killos and plugged in with migos
My dog Dark Jack, he stretch just like a regal
We get thumbs up when we ride past your people

[Chorus]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard

I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Where I come from, my mind
I ain't the one

[Verse 1: ALLBLACK]
Birdie told me you was speakin' on me
Told that birdie I'm gettin' money, I don't care what he said
Y'all want ALLBLACK to be like James Stacey
Wouldn't stop runnin' if the doc amputated my legs
Run up a thirty strip and a tip out thirteen breads
Grindin' like Chris Cole 'cause I gotta keep Maxine fed
The words stop, quarter done, never roll off my tongue
Take the pedals off the bike, I'ma hop on the pegs
Niggas be Mike Epps, so goddamn funny
Hangin' around all these OG's and still ain't got no money
Hop around bitches tryna get fed like a white Dutch bunny
Keep tellin' fables on these beats and you might get lucky
Jenna ignored me, now she on me, they think I'm a dummy
I was in that Bronco with no cash, she would roast and record me
See me with HBK P-Lo and I was tearin' up Nordy's
Don't give a fuck if your name Cardi, I won't let you touch me
Nah I'm lyin', I'ma whip out and let the ho suck me
Let her think shit all gravy, take her out when it's sunny
Let her fade up on some packs, think she make her some money
And kick a four three on her dumb ass like '08 Humpty
I can't feed your old beggin' ass
You better dig deep for some change in that Michael Kors bag
Don't call my phone with that brother shit, askin' for dollars
Go ask that bitch you fuckin' on 'cause I ain't one of your partners it's BLACK

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I got the flavor
Jordan Downs, I was a savior
I got the flavor, I got the flavor
Hopped in the game, kept it player
I need the cheese, every layer
Come with the sauce like a cater
Give me the mouth like a gator

[Verse 2: Prada Mack]
I know some Zoes in the gator, I know some Zoes in Decatur
I took that show on the road, yeah I sold some zones in Decatur
Can't go for broke that's a no no
Mutumbo, my hustle on full grown gorilla
My body is covered in Bape
And Worcester sauce on my steak
And shoulders with bosses, don't shake hands with snakes
Now look, my mind too
That slime juice is in my Simply, all I need is a lighter fool
But he walk in these crime scene shoes
It's gon' be hard for you to find these Loubs
Heavy handed, I really sip when I ply the juice
Ayy, I'm booted up, all this shit on me
A young dog's on that shit, watch your lips on me
All this sauce on me, I'd hate for shit to get salty
My niggas come with poles and one goal like they went golfing
Catered to who, oh I see you think this shit come easy
I don't owe a nigga nothin', only dish out for my mama and seed
So I'ma tell you straight faced, go find a better reason
And hope a way to get some money is where the shit lead you

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I got the flavor
Jordan Downs, I was a savior
I got the flavor, I got the flavor
Hopped in the game, kept it player
I need the cheese, every layer
Come with the sauce like a cater
Give me the mouth like a gator

[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Yeah
You lil' bitch ass niggas steady speaking up on the low
If these project walls could talk
They'd be just like 03, you dig?
03

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch, I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen'
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
I couldn't stop the Xan' before I had money
But I been dressin' like this way before they fuckin' loved me
Feel it in my stomach, molly might just make me vomit
Takin' acid with the shrooms, I'm tryna see my conscience
Too much hype in my life
You not with the gang so I'm not tryna hear no tides
I'm not tryna hear no sides
I can't believe you out here in these streets livin' lies
You really think that you tough
Callin' his bluff but we really be loadin' them nines
They DM'ed me at 8:05
Put it on me, had that boy gone like 8:59 (On me)
You can feel it in your spine
Everybody pointin' at you 'cause you are not right
We gonna take ten of yours if you ever try take one of mines
Wasn't for me, then you would've been died
If them walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
They said crack kills but my boys sellin' hard
They say last bitch test the work went to Mars
She suck my dick for ten bucks with no arms
That was back when times was hard
That was back before I had these millions that I earned
Wet up your block with a leg and an arm
With that burner, we aim at your head and start perms
Keep that shit one hundred, boy, you keep it twenty
We just caught an opp, we thought that shit was funny
Funny part about it, we knew we was gon' catch him one day
And on the ground, he all up shakin', holdin' on his stomach
Man, fuck all them looks
I had to go get that bread so I could put money on them books
That boy look shook every time that he look
But I ain't gotta touch him 'cause karma's a douche
My dreads done got long, this shit just was a bush
I got a boy from the block that's a cook
He whipped up some salmon, taste better than it look
He cookin' dogfood, the type that make you woof
You try to take this shit, I'll get you tooked
These niggas snitchin', they tryna write a book
Ninety thousand dollars, that's just for one of my hooks
Please do not compare me to none of these crooks

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch, I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Niggas act like I ain't make the beat to this and ""Crimey""
""Like A Nigga,"" ""Sweet Lady,"" ""Picc A Side,"" and ""Slidin'""
""Murder Music,"" ""Makin' Plays,"" ""Shittin' Lately,"" ""Molly""
Legend over night, bitch, I got songs with everybody
You need help from anybody, you still ain't caught a body
Niggas said they made me pop but scared to come and get it poppin'
My whole life a livin' hell, bitch, just come and homicide me
All this time I got of missin' friends to fuckin' traumatize me
I don't need no man opinion, not to qualify me
You be spendin' money on your wrist from what the law providin'
Nowadays snitches hangin' out like, ""Nigga, why we hidin'?""
Floatin' 'cross these motherfuckin' hits, just had an out of body
God Level, nigga, I bailed out in '16
Greedy rep 03, Uzi rep 16
Platinum albums from a cell, ain't no walkie-talkie
Pushin' button, playin' possum
Hold on, hold up, cops is watchin'

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch, I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard

You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

[Outro: 03 Greedo]
And we do it for Lil Money
Yeah, long live Lil Money
Oh, money changes everything

Ooh, yeah

[Intro]
X load it up bro
Back to it, we went back to the future
X on the beat, make it boom

[Chorus]
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the, woo, back to the bucket
Back to the, ayy, back to the bucket
Back to the, yeah, back to the Cutlass
Back to the, damn, back to the Cutlass

[Verse 1]
I remember I was strugglin'
Woke up and I started hustling
And I had to get that muscle
Flexin', leave these peoples puzzled
Chopper, no we ain't gon' touch him
Green was sproutin' up, no brussel
Orange hairs like I'm fucking Chucky
White girls like I'm fucking Jason
Live my dream just like I'm Freddy
Got the bodies in the basement
Dead bodies, dead bodies, talkin' presidents
Everybody know I'll get you out of here, no evidence
Ayy ayy, ayy, pull up at your residence
Ayy, ayy, niggas gon' be heaven sent
Go to jail only way we go to hell
All these niggas actin' frail, I put packages in mail, boy
Ayy, like the paper boy

[Chorus]
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the, woo, back to the bucket
Back to the, ayy, back to the bucket
Back to the, yeah, back to the Cutlass
Back to the, damn, back to the Cutlass

[Verse 2]
Back to the business, back to the bitches
Back to the riches, Bally Total Fitness, put weight on my bitches
Like a trainer, I'm a gang banger, not an entertainer
But I'm famous, bought a banger 'fore I ever let my chain swang 'em
Smoke another zone, bitch we Cheech and Chong
Ridin' with my niggas whether right or wrong, ayy, ayy
Most of these rappers'll write a statement 'fore they write a song
In my trap I'm doin' numbers like Celine Dion
Put that Tech inside my beverage just to calm me down
You want static, it get hectic, then you not around
Bitch you gotta be protected in the Jordan Downs
Bitch you gotta be protected in the Jordan Downs

[Chorus]
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the, woo, back to the bucket
Back to the, ayy, back to the bucket
Back to the, yeah, back to the Cutlass
Back to the, damn, back to the Cutlass

[Outro]
Ooh, take 'em back to that Cutlass, ooh, ayy
Take 'em back to that Cutlass, ooh, ooh
Take 'em back to when I was strugglin', ooh
Take 'em back to when I was hustlin'
Back to that, back, back, back, back back
Back to that, back, back back, back, back back
Ooh, damn, Drummer Gang, we gon'
Ayy, ayy, ayy ayy, ayy ayy, ooh

I'ma be your conscience
I'ma be your conscience
I ain't bein' too conscious
Whoa Kenny

[Chorus]
I know a lame when I see it
Bitch I know hate when I hear it
I take a few drugs when I need it
So hard to look in the mirror
That's me, that's me
That's me, that's me

[Verse]
I'm that purple devil on your left shoulder
In some Raf Simons screaming hit the yola
I would do anything to fulfill my dreams
But I'm sippin' lean if a nigga blow it
Smoking city weed, I'm in California
Got a Texas lawyer taking Texas cases
Wanna be my homie, you gon' have to take it
'Cause I'm paper chasin' and these peoples racist
My lil brother Paul on your other shoulder
On the same shit, but he's still an angel
Tryna work my move, you gotta see my angle
Like my hands out, 2 L's in front
Like you get the picture and you're tryna frame it
Mind on drugs, I've been tryna change it
Gotta sacrifice when you're gangbanging
Fuck the interstate and that's an understatement
I was out of state for the entertainment
Dancing on a girl you remind me of
Like I'm Usher Raymond, tryna knock the vacant
Granddaddy house, I was in the basement
In the S-E-L, playing with the bangers
If you're in this world you should do the same
It's the only reason I done became famous
Gotta be a gangster, gotta keep it player
Never one way, gotta keep some layers
Stack Monday, gotta clean the paper
Lil Money laying, gotta peek and prayin'
Lost him in the Beamer, drove my peoples crazy
Been through situations that'll keep you mainy
Fuck a pussy nigga, I can't see too many
I can't do the Xanax, drive my people zany
Need a new Mercedes, pull up in the Maybies

[Chorus]
I know a lame when I see it
Bitch I know hate when I hear it
I take a few drugs when I need it
So hard to look in the mirror
That's me, that's me
That's me, that's me
I could be your conscience, I'ma be your conscience
I could be your conscience, I could be your conscience
I'ma be your conscience, I'ma be your conscience
I could be your conscience
I know a lame when I see it
Bitch, I know hate when I hear it
I take a few drugs when I need it
So hard to look in the mirror
I know a lame when I see it
Bitch, I know hate when I hear it
I take a few drugs when I need it
So hard to look in the mirror
I'ma be your conscience

Gettin' chicken, ran into the heater
Sneakin' geekin', hit her in the sneakers
Fuck a greetin' and it's nice to met you
Talk is cheap and these haters cheaper
Treatin' every thottie like she ain't a keeper
Tell a bad bitch bye Felicia
Won't see you next Friday either

Took a charge and didn't say shit
Sweet lady, need a replacement
You feel good, get left for ravin'
Fly bitch from where I be bangin'
[?] in my fuckin' favor
Bitch, I'm from another planet
Where we speak a different language
Fuck the jury and the plaintiff
Word to Chase, he fuckin' saved me
Reason why I got the [?]
Now I'm here to bring the plaques
Hottest shit since Michael Jackson
Janet Jackson, satisfaction
Love my sisters on some black shit
White girl in my fuckin' baggage
White girl made me fuckin' happy
Fuck the bounty, I'm just laughin'
'Cause you drove out here to grab me
I got out soon as I landed
Waited longer on the package
Now they know I'm really trappin'
And I still don't know what happened
Realest nigga in first class
The realest statement in your caption
""#Free03, my favourite rapper""

[Break]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
If I wasn't rappin' baby
03
Yeah, yeah
If I wasn't rappin' baby

[Chorus]
If I wasn't rappin', baby
You know I'd be trappin' daily
Shippin' shit, I'm wrappin' babies
She say I be actin' shady
Wake up and I'm after payments
Bitch, I'm tryna grab Mercedes
If I wasn't rappin', baby
You know I'd be trappin' daily
Shippin' shit, I'm wrappin' babies
She say I be actin' shady
Wake up and I'm after payments
Bitch, I'm tryna grab Mercedes

[Outro]
And I'm playin' them naked ladies
Save the cash and never save 'em
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I'd be back stuck on the pavement
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I'd've never left the station
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I'd still be on that vacation
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I'd never be here to taste ya
That's the part that drive you crazy
'Member when I caught them cases
You thought they would take you, Jason
Thank the Lord I wasn't patient
I did it without the stations
Took a loss and rearranged it

[Intro: 03 Greedo]
You say you tryna ride for a nigga who hatin' on you, you know what I'm sayin'
Have your bitch back, you know what I'm sayin'
Now you fuckin', shit, he fuckin' your bitch and then he like have your bitch back, you know what I'm sayin'
We ain't, we ain't doin' all that man
Don't touch a nigga while he just got a motherfuckin' mistress

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
We don't beef with these niggas over these bitches
Really came out of the trenches, all my niggas is some hitters
All this textin' is ridiculous, tweetin', typin', post an image
Have you ever been offended off the women that we pimpin'
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Have you ever been somebody, no, chopper make your body rock
Drummer Gang my second label, hundred bullets first of all
All money in, stupid bitches never goin' out
No dates, no dates, we don't do no hangin' out
In the kitchen makin' straight rich gang bangers
Outside, other side where I reside, free my cuzzo doin' time
I'm like fuck it, do a line, pop a molly all the time
Let me fuck her with my nine, she a freak, she a thot
Shake somethin', shake somethin', like pepper and salt
I'm the nigga with the sauce, all this flavor in her mouth
Baby got the drip now, you can tell she talkin' different
Must've been around some niggas that'll raise her eyebrow

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
We don't beef with these niggas over these bitches
Really came out of the trenches, all my niggas is some hitters

[Verse 2: J. Stone]
We ain't catchin' feelings for pussy poppin', hood boppin'
She gon' take the homies out flockin', you gon' take her shoppin'
All money inner and out, thumbin' through all the bands
Clique full of Drummers, I ain't talkin' 'bout a marching band
I'm the driver and the shooter, got the MAC with the cooler
I'm a mack and a ruler, blowin' racks with my jewelers
She got ass, I'ma toot her, beat it fast and I boot her
Pass her to my producer L-Finguz
Twist my fingers up, I don't give a single fuck
Used to drive the Regal Cut, now I want a Bentley truck
Switch it up, she back that ass up, I be rich rollin'
You can have that bitch back, you report that bitch stolen

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
We don't beef with these niggas over these bitches
Really came out of the trenches, all my niggas is some hitters

[Verse 3: J. Stone]
We don't beef with you niggas over these bitches
Got my mind on a million since they let me out of prison
Backwood roller, I ain't fuckin' with no swishers
And I got a whole pint, I ain't fuckin' with no liquor
Fuck her then I diss her, you gon' tell her that you miss her
I don't cuff her, I don't kiss her, I don't love her 'cause it's money over bitches
Or should I say riches over snitches
My whole clique is million dollar niggas
Bitch learn somethin', twerk somethin'
Twerk somethin', she gon' fuckin' hurt somethin'
Got the pussy soakin' wet, she gon' fuckin' squirt somethin'
I'm a soldier and a vet, fuck around and murk somethin'
I'm a rider for the set, turn nothin' into somethin'

[Chorus: Bino Rideaux]
I been counting money forward, I don't back track
Every night I pray the lord he bring that Act back
If my brother bring a play then I'ma latch that
And we came up out the gutter as a matter fact
I pull up on her, it's a party in my way back
Fall in love, ain't got no feelings, you can have that
I'ma pull up with no ceilings at your address
Let that chopper get to drilling, be like grah grah

[Verse 1: Bino Rideaux]
All I wanted was hundreds on my C day
Niggas be talkin', we don't believe it
Came out the struggle, I live and breathe it
I'm still pouring, Drakeo still be fiendin'
I'm still bringin' them stacks in with no D-day
Yeah, I make her bust it on the freeway
You can't put no budget on what we make
Never give a fuck nigga no leeway
I was 'bout my hustle back in pre-K
Used to dress the flyest on a free day
Long as you supplying I'm receiving
Fucked my bitch all night and then I'm leaving
'Cause niggas spending money and I need it
I'm riding with Envy, he gon' grow up
Pull up on your block and be like show up
I don't talk to no bitch about niggas
But your bitch talk to niggas, niggas know us

[Verse 2: Drakeo the Ruler]
Niggas know me, I'm the Ruler, I don't back track
If you pull up in a coupe I can match that
Off this mud, buck fifty in the fast track
I'm sick of niggas and these subs, I'ma crash 'em
Always acting out in public, I'm a class clown
Money doing Benihanas, I'm an asshole
I'm drinking red, I wish a nigga'd bring the Act back
Nigga dressing like he on but he crack cars
All big banc uchies, look at dashboards
In a max sport, the flu flamming rap star
All up in your news feeds
Kick door, Bruce Lee, never drove a hoopty
Sick of niggas boosting, I'm strangling Judas
Told I'm a nuisance, these niggas must be stupid
They think I'm 'bout to bow down, you might just tap out now
We fix grills like pow wow, the Stincs got the laugh now
Maylene give my MAC round, don't rap beef 'cause that's out

I been counting money forward, I don't back track
Every night I pray the lord he bring that Act back
If my brother bring a play then I'ma latch that

It's early in the morning
She's chilling as I'm noting
And I'ma get that fire on niggas
I don't live let die on niggas
Remember where I left sight on niggas, my side don't sleep
Homicide lowkey, high notes [?] or the safety squared on my sleep
New belt, Louis V, best dressed, clean feet
No socks, two G's for the slip-on loafers
Grape singing like McQueen for my neck
Purple diamonds, blue diamonds on the Titanic
Lately I been on my tip like an iceberg
You was digging your boogers, I got that drip that I was splashin'
Club flashin', fast loves in the club, got shit for these rappers
Twice I [?] love, that's just for these trappers

[Chorus: Bino Rideaux]
I been counting money forward, I don't back track

[Intro: Drakeo the Ruler]
I tried to tell you nigga, shit get deep
The homewrecker, Paul Bunyan knocking down Christmas trees
Mr. T chains, yeah it's glistening tremendously
It's all about the benjamins, a hundred when I stick and move
It’s the 2, Greedy bastards in a Bentley coupe
Acting like Mystikal with eighty bands on Instagram
Ignant, belligerent
I should've went to college with my penmanship

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck
A hundred on the Draco mean a hundred niggas dead
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck
A hundred on the Draco mean a hundred niggas dead
Stop playing with me
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Punk bitch I got a hundred in my men and that
Hundred dance like ten and ask
And they all got bloody neck, bitch I made it out the 'ject
Pussy ass niggas couldn't stop it now I got respect
Birdman of the set, ho you see me taking rip
You ain't seen a hundred yet, all my niggas runnin' trip
That lil pussy nigga who was hating, I just split his wig
I ain't tryna one again so you just be on weird shit
Real shit, not the type of nigga that I deal with
When I sign a deal for a million, it's cheap to pay killing
'Cause more than they want money, niggas die to feel this feeling
Meanwhile remix and go down in pieces
Bitch we a whole 'nother species

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck
A hundred on the Draco mean a hundred niggas dead
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck
A hundred on the Draco mean a hundred niggas dead
Stop playing with me
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good

[Verse 2: Drakeo the Ruler]
A hundred in the Draco, a hundred ain't no snaking
I'm finding out a hundred, another hundred whip Mercedes
If I don't get a J pay then you don't call me baby
Crazy, lady, give 'em stinky faces
I'm dealing with emotions only 'cause it's entertainment
When a nigga sneak diss me he get shot for entertainment
Stop playin', my lil niggas shady
A nigga wouldn't be rappin' but I do this shit for KD

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck
A hundred on the Draco mean a hundred niggas dead
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck

You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good

Wait back up, say it again

Mister mister mister mister mister, shit

If I go down when I end up out of town
Just understand that I just wanted to live
'Cause when you young and tryna make it where I'm from
They don't want to let you raise your own kids
Fuck what these scary peoples always talkin' 'bout
You gotta get out there and take you a risk

Keep her in Jordan, she say kids be tryna take my style
So fuck it, time for Gucci, ain't think we would make it out
Can't be from Drummer Gang if your kids say you ain't around
Can't be from Drummer Gang if you ain't finna lay shit down
Ho least against us, these hoes disrespectful

Stay by my side when I got shot, that's how I know you special
These bad ass kids are not your peers so don't go fold to pressure
This ain't 'bout tough or weak no more, this shit 'bout thinkin' better

And I got metal for a shin, still ain't no half steppin'
You know it ain't nothin' changin' but our addresses

Sold me some weed, I ain't wanna play sports
Jump out of cars with some things we can't afford
I know some flockers still knockin' at your doors
Either you get killed, go to jail or have a jump shot
Focus on your skills, boy, you know you only got one shot
Used to have fire drills, they ain't show us how to duck gun shots

[Chorus]
I heard 03 got all day
My side, two bitches in one whip
Niggas thought it was all over
Beatin' me, how can I sober
Say I'm surrounded by vultures
Now I'm surrounded by soldiers
Should we get right to the gunplay
He got a hundred he gon' say
I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard

[Verse]
That we went down undercover
I'm back out on bail and I'm still raising hell
Feeling like Slater or Screech, got a white girl with me and got saved by the bell
Look at me funny, they want me to disappear like I'm Dave Chappelle
I get it out of thin air, still gettin' packs in the mail
What type of drugs do you sell?
Last year I needed some help
Now I can get it myself
I was the shit in the cell
Thought I won't get out of jail
People sayin' I got ninety-nine years
I got ninety-nine sales for your bitch and I'm here
Ninety-nine problems but bitches ain't near
Xanny barbarian like I'm golden ear
Purple a soldier but I don't romance
I'm usually off a few lines when I dance
Baby got me in the times when I glance
I turn a white girl and pry with no hands
Kitchen whippin' 'til I go down again
Drummer gang family, we don't want no friends
Test that nigga to the final exam
I left the hood like the white boys and text the Trans-Ams
Free my bro Speed, let's get back to them grams
Free Facka Flee, free Yapo every time
Free Scavy D, slugs on me, this god's plan

[Chorus]
I heard 03 got all day
My side, two bitches in one whip
Niggas thought it was all over
Beatin' me, how can I sober
Say I'm surrounded by vultures
Now I'm surrounded by soldiers
Should we get right to the gunplay
He got a hundred he gon' say
I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard

[Outro]
I, I heard I got life
I heard I went on the run, I heard I wasn't on the run
I'm lyin' 'bout a case, I don't chat Greedo bro
Greedo back, keep talkin', hey, ho
More money, more change
More money, more change
More money, more change

I'm like paranoid
Know what I'm sayin', street niggas be like, we don't go to fuckin' church
Playmakers
Unless I'm going to a funeral, know what I'm sayin'
Ain't nobody get married where I'm from, know what I'm sayin'
When it be crazy I still call on her, you dig
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
Praying to God, caught a lil faith a long time ago
When it get hard, he's just the one that I'm callin' on
Praying to God, yeah
Praying to God

[Verse 1]
Got on my knees and prayed, tryna delete the hate
I cannot hesitate, I gotta navigate
I know agitate, I know I aggravate
I had to levitate, then they would gravitate
Ask my bitch 'cause she bring me my preference
I get high 'cause I'm needing my blessings
Have you ever been in the streets, lost your best friend?
Have you ever bought your weed from the Mexicans?
I really ran in the plugs
I'm really runnin' up drugs
Road runner, run it up
Pray to God, I need love

[Pre-Chorus]
Prayin' to God, prayin' to God
Prayin' to God, prayin' to God

I'm fightin' my demons, these niggas is leeches
These niggas be thiefin', watch out for they greetin'
These bitches be griefin', they niggas be leavin'
You know they ain't break up, ain't nothin' I can make up
Everybody been through shake-ups, go to prison when you wake up
He was just sleep on his feet, he was just sleep on the streets
Pull up with the street sweep
These niggas preyin' on me
These niggas hatin' on me
They tryna crucify me

I walk on water like Jesus

Life is Montana and me
Niggas'll never be me

03 Greedo - Shittin (Lately)


Count it up, count it

Count it up count it, 03
I got the cash on the wake up
My bitch look bad with no make up
She give me big face like [?]
Spend a lil time, but never no dime
How many grounds just to get a payment
Put my kids on their belly she still ain't break me
Too many rounds on my waistline
Might hit the house in the day time
Might try and fuck with that wok hard
I’m trying to see what it tastes like
I want that chick with the green booty just to give me a thing with that big old booty
Put that gold in my mouth, i want every colour
One burgundy, gold and one white and one yellow
Water might leak out the eyes of my bezel
And catch a hoe slipping just like rainy weather
Make it rain make it rain, purple rain slurricane
I was at the droozy with the gang, never need her again
Walking [?], 	[	?	]
Fresh to death when i got here, joints off when they release these bitches
These niggas sweeter than DiddyRieses, these niggas cheap [?]
Never ever owe a still greedy nigga, since my first song you seen me nigga
I been rapping bout jackin these [?]niggas, how come you mad when you see me nigga
Niggas told me I’m banged out like i ain't go for 4 pistols nigga

I been shittin on you niggas lately, I been shittin on you niggas lately
I been shittin you niggas lately i been getting bitches so you niggas hate me
I been shittin on you niggas lately


Free my hitters free my hitters
Soldier down with the troops. rollin round in the coupe
Rollin rounds of that 03, so I’m rollin rounds of that droof
Hunnit rounds in that AK, that F&N go poof
Mafia, keep it mafia, might hurt mans in my suit
It ain't always got to be a big pistol
Might bounce around, ‘doosh doosh’
And shoot a round 32
Like magic johnson, all of magic city
Fell in love with hunnits thats the sweetest feeling
When ya touching money touching ass and titties
In ya cleanest nikes and your dopest jacket
On the scene shining cos you know they flashing
I ain't talking cameras, see the naked dancers
Tell them make it nasty, see we making plans
While we making plays
Had a business meeting with the plug at five
While i blew blue hunnits in the crib, blue flame
You would think we’d drip by the way we touch that game
If you feel my music you done touched that pain
Put a    [?],      don’t touch that drank
Like the garbage disposal, will chop them veins
Too graphic, greedy, so specific, cus she know we lived it
Hopped out in traffic put that shit in plastic

I been shittin on you niggas lately, I been shittin on you niggas lately
I been shittin you niggas lately i been getting bitches so you niggas hate me
I been shittin on you niggas lately

She said she gon' let me meet 'em (Ooh)

Maria, she full of grace, travelin' out the state
Matter fact the country, balloons while I float away
Powder in her nose, ain't no makeup on her face
She ain't tryna make mistakes 'cause I know where this lady stay
Change the case and raise the stakes, I rode up in eight estate
Baby, I'm a wolf, so moon and, nigga, let's see the cake
She shit out the project, then we clean it and weigh away
Drummer Gang don't save the base, we handin' out 808's
Chopper turn a nigga dirty dreads to a taper fade
AR's for everyone, go open with artillery
Hit a nigga artery, make a nigga amputate (Ka-ka-ka, ka-ka-ka, ka-ka-ka, ka-ka-ka)

[Chorus]
Tryna pull up in a Tesla with my feet up
Keep fuckin' up my re-up

I'm in the club doin' the same... 03
Same old two step

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
She ain't scared to come to the gutter
She pull up just like she should
She don't let me leave without money
She dump the guts out my wood
She put that lean in my beverage
When she load my heat she look sexy
Put me back on my feet when I stepped in
That's why I treat her so good
Put me back on my feet when I stepped in
That's why I treat her so good

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
First off I got it lit like Prospect
I'm in the club doin' the same old two step
Living legends, all the lost ones I respect
Drakeo make a sneak diss and hit the reject
Hands up, this ain't no nae nae, we gon' hit them folks
In East Atlanta really whippin' with the kitchen fork
Bitch ride with me, my bitch ride for me
My bitch lie for me and my bitch ride on me
Even though I'm from South California
Took her down on the south side of Florida
On the run, she let me dog all 'til the morning
I can't show up to no girl without a Laurie

[Chorus: 03 Greedo & Dubba-AA]
She ain't scared to come to the gutter
She pull up just like she should

That's why I treat her so good

[Verse 2: Dubba-AA]
Yeah I love all of my bitches
They treat me just like they should
Cannot fuck with no bitch if she bougie

Young nigga, need a Beyonce

Keep the money comin' in like every day
From MIA to the West like Kim K
I don't really like to move, really like to dance
'Cause I got the tool off in my pants
Baby is you gon' ride for me?
If it go down is you gon' slide for me?

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
She ain't scared to come to the gutter
She pull up just like she should

The street shit is all a nigga know
I'ma have to get it how it go
Wonder why they always tryna lie, tellin' lies

The street shit is all a nigga know
I'ma have to get it how it go
Wonder why they always tryna lie, tellin' lies

[Verse 1: Lil Pete]
By myself, I ain't never needed you
Twenty bands, I could count blues on blues
Strip club, VIP, we drinkin' mud with it
I don't want it by myself unless the thugs get it
I fell in love with the street shit
And I ain't even gon' lie
I fell in love with this fast life
Fast money, fast cars, and the trap life
We gon' get it out the mud
Fuck your cosign, we don't need your love
I pull up to the block with the thugs
Wrong wrong turn, we might shoot shit up
Every time somethin' happens, we the ones to blame
Know they comin' when I call, I don't gotta say
Bro kinda mainy but he go brazy
Never fall for these hoes, yeah they can't play me

At the bus stop right by the store

'Til my lil brother died
Just another homicide
I can't swallow my pride
I don't never go to sleep, I ain't lyin' down
You the hottest in the street, oh we lyin' now?
Well I guess I am a pussy and I am a bitch
Well I guess I am a rookie, guess I am a snitch

And my big homie be 'round for connectin'
Love to save the internet, but enough with the sex shit
Pullin' up in the intersection
If a nigga testin', I been aggressively flexin'

All of that shit don't impress me

She take a sniff, I take a sip, and she the one that's movin' slow
If I go broke, get that dough out your ho
I was taught to get it out the mud, the tender age of four
I'm not broke any more
Suicide my left door
Shovels goin' on my toe
It was a perfect summer
A new no limit when I pull up, damn

Soldiered down with Soldier Reezy
And I came with the Drummers
Got a pound of California and I know who want it
Marijuana, oh it make me ghost

Just got a pint and I tote a nine
Sixty a line, I paid fifty-five

03, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ooh ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Chorus]
Nowadays only niggas gossip
When I pull up on these niggas niggas switch the topic
I heard all these pussy niggas talkin'
I ain't never seen you get it poppin'

[Verse 1]
Brand new Guccis, wore 'em twice, I had to break 'em in
My lil hottie wanna fight, you tryna take him in
Your lil nigga mad at us 'cause we been fakin' friends
I make your niggas, make a hater want to make amends
I might freestyle this whole album 'cause I hate the pen
I put that beef shit in the hood so I could bait 'em in
I'm from the area with the LA Rams and Raiders fans
I'm in the field and I been makin' plays and makin' plans
Fuck a rumor, prove it to us, bro you act like you the shooter
Fuck all of them questions in the section, ho why you ain't do it?
Took some L's, I'm on the run, lil heard 'em walk inside the trap
Lost my lil brother and my burner, still had time for music
And I'm on these pussy niggas' ass every time I do it
Niggas tried to leave me out for dead, I ain't fuckin' stupid
Dirty project nigga, I don't want my dreads done
Talkin' 'bout a nigga but these niggas get they nails done

[Chorus]
Uh, nowadays only niggas gossip
When I pull up on these niggas niggas switch the topic
I heard all these pussy niggas talkin'
I ain't never seen you get it poppin'

When I pull up on these niggas niggas switch the topic
I heard all these pussy niggas talkin'
I ain't never seen you get it poppin'

[Verse 2]
Still ain't lyin' in my raps, foot on these niggas' necks
We told you pull up in the hood, you still ain't show up yet
Why a nigga bitch ain't really 'bout the disrespect
You tried to tell a nigga sorry, people don't forget
Let's be real, you ain't a nigga been about the trap
Still ain't did shit 'bout who chased you down with a strap
When I pull up you get missin' nigga, that's a fact
I hear them stories, you can flip 'em like an acrobat
First of all this fakin' 'bout some shit you overheard
That really ain't your business 'til you put in on the bird
Second off your really never made it off the curb
Everybody know my business now, I keep my word
Third of all I never marked down in my fuckin' life
Most of all I would never fuck a lame wife
Buying drugs when I took money, music saved my life
I made this album just to bust on niggas I don't like

[Chorus]
Nowadays only niggas gossip
When I pull up on these niggas niggas switch the topic
I heard all these pussy niggas talkin'
I ain't never seen you get it poppin'

When I'm OT and I'm breaking down boulders
I gotta look over my shoulder
I put the juice in my soda
To stay calm when I'm touching that yola
Me and J feel like G-Boy and Yola
Can't believe that our dog's life is over
Mercy me, worry me
Put them snakes around my collar when they bury me
'Cause it kept it G, they still hated me
Who enemigos wanna be in that two plane and see
Just got a room but in the lobby was emergency
Bullets in me but they wasn't tryna murder me
And that's the part that worry me
'Cause I can't let these niggas bury me

Come and get your bitch boy, I admit I get 'nnoyed
When she spend the night and I get in it like a hemmroid
I know it hurt, I hit that ass, I'm talkin' shit boy
Me and Scars 'em, Lil Money, Ray, and Big Boy
Who else would think
I'm asking God to wake me up from this nightmare and dream
I swear my life so bittersweet, it feel like both things
I got one foot in industry and one foot in the streets
I got some people bangin' grape but way in Tennessee
New York, Atlanta, Texas, Carolina
Call and see, private callers callin' me
I took a flight later that night and end up in the D
Was way in Phoenix when they tried to get a hold of me

Paranoid, hearin' voices
